system was devised by the German astronomer Julius Scheiner (1858–1913) in 1894 originally as a method of comparing the speeds of plates used for astronomical photography.
Austria, particularly Kaunitz, used this situation to their utmost advantage.
The cardinal protodeacon, the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals, has the privilege of announcing a new pope's election and name (once he has been ordained to the Episcopate) from the central balcony at the Basilica of Saint Peter in Vatican City State.
In the past, during papal coronations, the proto-deacon also had the honor of bestowing the pallium on the new pope and crowning him with the papal tiara.
Before the advent of the ASA system, the system of Weston film speed ratings was introduced by Edward Faraday Weston (1878–1971) and his father Dr. Edward Weston (1850–1936), a British-born electrical engineer, industrialist and founder of the US-based Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation, with the Weston model 617, one of the earliest photo-electric exposure meters, in August 1932.
The Weston Cadet (model 852 introduced in 1949), Direct Reading (model 853 introduced 1954) and Master III (models 737 and S141.3 introduced in 1956) were the first in their line of exposure meters to switch and utilize the meanwhile established ASA scale instead.
Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent.
Pitt Head of the government from 1756 to 1761, and even after that the British continued his strategy.

The systems for determining the sensitivity for an emulsion are possible because reciprocity holds.
The Prussian army marched in three columns.
The manufacturers do not indicate that the 3200 number is an ISO rating on their packaging.
Meanwhile, Frederick and Field Marshal Keith would make for Dresden.
For digital photo cameras ("digital still cameras"), an exposure index (EI) rating—commonly called ISO setting—is specified by the manufacturer such that the sRGB image files produced by the camera will have a lightness similar to what would be obtained with film of the same EI rating at the same exposure.
The Saxon and Austrian armies were unprepared, and their forces were scattered.
Frederick occupied Dresden with little or no opposition from the Saxons.
The attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage across Europe and led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition.
The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia.
The Standard Output Sensitivity (SOS) technique, also new in the 2006 version of the standard, effectively specifies that the average level in the sRGB image must be 18% gray plus or minus 1/3 stop when the exposure is controlled by an automatic exposure control system calibrated per ISO 2721 and set to the EI with no exposure compensation.
With this army he slowly moved to relieve Prague.
Two ratios are used, the 40:1 ("excellent image quality") and the 10:1 ("acceptable image quality") ratio.
The signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the standard deviation of a weighted average of the luminance and color of individual pixels.
His defeats on the battlefield brought still more opportunist nations into the war.
Sweden felt this small army was all that was needed to occupy Pomerania and felt the Swedish army would not need to engage with the Prussians because the Prussians were occupied on so many other fronts.
Things were looking grim for Prussia now, with the Austrians mobilising to attack Prussian-controlled soil and a French army under Soubise approaching from the west.
In addition, an exposure latitude can be specified, ranging from the saturation-based speed to the 10:1 noise-based speed.
In spite of this, the Prussians were now facing the prospect of four major powers attacking on four fronts (France from the West, Austria from the South, Russia from the East and Sweden from the North).
The camera may also report the SOS-based speed (explicitly as being an SOS speed), rounded to the nearest standard speed rating.
On the other hand, Younger Avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as Old Persian, but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its "old" characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had yielded to their Middle Iranian stage.
Following the publication of CIPA DC-004 in 2006, Japanese manufacturers of digital still cameras are required to specify whether a sensitivity rating is REI or SOS.
Over the winter the new commander of the Hanoverian forces, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, regrouped his army and launched a series of offensives that drove the French back across the River Rhine.
Also, foreign references to languages can also provide a hint to the existence of otherwise unattested languages, for example through toponyms/ethnonyms or in the recording of vocabulary, as Herodotus did for what he called "Scythian".
The city consists of sixteen municipalities (previously called boroughs).
These terms have little meaning with respect to Old Avestan as that stage of the language may predate the settling of the Iranian peoples into western and eastern groups.
A further complication however concerns the consonant clusters *ćw and *dźw:

Given that Mexico City is organized entirely as a Federal District, most of the city services are provided or organized by the Government of the Federal District and not by the boroughs themselves, while in the constituent states these services would be provided by the municipalities.
The 16 boroughs of the Federal District with their 2010 populations are:
Consequently, when the American War of Independence turned into a global war between 1778–83, Britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of European powers, and lacking any substantial ally.
The CGS unit of luminance is the stilb, which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10 kcd/m2.

Mining was important in Thuringia since the later Middle Ages, especially within the mining towns of the Thuringian Forest such as Schmalkalden, Suhl and Ilmenau.
Following the industrial revolution, the old iron, copper and silver mines declined because the competition from imported metal was too strong.
On the other hand, the late 19th century brought new types of mines to Thuringia: the lignite surface mining around Meuselwitz near Altenburg in the east of the Land started in the 1870s, and two potash mining districts were established around 1900.

Much of the city centre was destroyed.
Erfurt's central station, which was completely rebuilt for this purpose in the 2000s (decade), will be the new connection between both ICE lines.
In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked).
It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors.
This caused more than 2,000 fires.
Two factors are considered here: How close the predator and prey are (in the latter two cases the term prey may be replaced with host) and whether or not the prey are directly murdered by the predator is considered, with true predation and parasitoidism involving certain death.
Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying.
After the First World War, work began again on the HD-4.
It was faster, able to catch the bombers and its configuration of four machine guns in a turret could (much like German night fighters in 1943–1945 with Schräge Musik) engage the unsuspecting German bomber from beneath.
It would prove formidable, but its development was slow.
Bell was a supporter of aerospace engineering research through the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), officially formed at Baddeck, Nova Scotia, in October 1907 at the suggestion of his wife Mabel and with her financial support after the sale of some of her real estate.

This image entered the historiography of the Second World War in the 1980s and 1990s, especially after the publication of Angus Calder's book The Myth of the Blitz (1991).
Introduction or removal of this predator, or changes in its population density, can have drastic cascading effects on the equilibrium of many other populations in the ecosystem.
This means that, at each applicable stage, predator and prey species are in an evolutionary arms race to maximize their respective abilities to obtain food or avoid being eaten.
To help celebrate his life, his wife asked guests not to wear black (the traditional funeral color) while attending his service, during which soloist Jean MacDonald sang a verse of Robert Louis Stevenson's "Requiem":

Extreme specialization of roles is evident in some hunting that requires co-operation between predators of very different species: humans with the aid of falcons or dogs, or fishing with cormorants.
They rapidly spread across the Kingdom, becoming so commonplace that in 965 King Edgar decreed that there should be no more than one alehouse per village.
The Act is administered by two federal agencies, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
It should also be noted that some species can be on both ends of a mobbing attack.
Crows are frequently mobbed by smaller songbirds as they prey on eggs and young from these birds' nests, but these same crows will cooperate with smaller birds to drive away hawks or larger mammalian predators.
Aposematism, where organisms are brightly colored as a warning to predators, is the antithesis of camouflage.
Traditional English ale was made solely from fermented malt.
For example, bright coloration in Variable Checkerspot butterflies leads to decreased predation attempts by avian predators.
While that particular prey organism may be killed, the coloring benefits the prey species as a whole.
It authorized the Secretary of the Interior to list endangered domestic fish and wildlife and allowed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to spend up to $15 million per year to buy habitats for listed species.
It also directed federal land agencies to preserve habitat on their lands.

For every 100 females, there were 92.0 males.
Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical defoliant or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze.
This is usually through loss resistance in the antenna's conductors, but can also be due to dielectric or magnetic core losses in antennas (or antenna systems) using such components.
Such loss effectively robs power from the transmitter, requiring a stronger transmitter in order to transmit a signal of a given strength.
How much of that power has actually been radiated cannot be directly determined through electrical measurements at (or before) the antenna terminals, but would require (for instance) careful measurement of field strength.
Fortunately the loss resistance of antenna conductors such as aluminum rods can be calculated and the efficiency of an antenna using such materials predicted.
People of Irish descent form the largest single ethnic group in the city, making up 15.8% of the population, followed by Italians, accounting for 8.3% of the population.
The loss within the antenna will affect the intended signal and the noise/interference identically, leading to no reduction in signal to noise ratio (SNR).
Hispanics in Boston are mostly of Puerto Rican (30,506 or 4.9% of total city population), Dominican (25,648 or 4.2% of total city population), Salvadoran (10,850 or 1.8% of city population), Colombian (6,649 or 1.1% of total city population), Mexican (5,961 or 1.0% of total city population), and Guatemalan (4,451 or 0.7% of total city population) ethnic origin.
This is likewise true for a receiving antenna at very high (especially microwave) frequencies, where the point is to receive a signal which is strong compared to the receiver's noise temperature.
Most AM broadcast radios (except for car radios) take advantage of this principle by including a small loop antenna for reception which has an extremely poor efficiency.
This can also be a refined product (absorbent cotton in U.S. usage) which has medical, cosmetic and many other practical uses.
Tourism also composes a large part of Boston's economy, with 21.2 million domestic and international visitors spending $8.3 billion in 2011; excluding visitors from Canada and Mexico, over 1.4 million international tourists visited Boston in 2014, with those from China and the United Kingdom leading the list.

In addition to concerns over subsidies, the cotton industries of some countries are criticized for employing child labor and damaging workers' health by exposure to pesticides used in production.
Transmission from a circularly polarized antenna received by a linearly polarized antenna (or vice versa) entails a 3 dB reduction in signal-to-noise ratio as the received power has thereby been cut in half.
A public genome sequencing effort of cotton was initiated in 2007 by a consortium of public researchers.
In some cases this is done in a more extreme manner, not simply to cancel a small amount of residual reactance, but to resonate an antenna whose resonance frequency is quite different from the intended frequency of operation.
"Tetraploid" means that cultivated cotton actually has two separate genomes within its nucleus, referred to as the A and D genomes.
Roxbury Community College and Bunker Hill Community College are the city's two public community colleges.
Altogether, Boston's colleges and universities employ over 42,600 people, accounting for nearly 7 percent of the city's workforce.
For a terrestrial antenna, the ground is usually one such object of importance.
Also, in the particular case of a monopole antenna, the ground (or an artificial ground plane) serves as the return connection for the antenna current thus having an additional effect, particularly on the impedance seen by the feed line.
No information is lost in lossless compression.
Boston shares many cultural roots with greater New England, including a dialect of the non-rhotic Eastern New England accent known as Boston English, and a regional cuisine with a large emphasis on seafood, salt, and dairy products.
Lossy compression reduces bits by identifying unnecessary information and removing it.
Boston also has its own collection of neologisms known as Boston slang.
The phase of reflection of electromagnetic waves depends on the polarization of the incident wave.
Some consider the Old Corner Bookstore, where these writers met and where The Atlantic Monthly was first published, to be "cradle of American literature.
Lossless compression is possible because most real-world data exhibits statistical redundancy.
The power remaining in the reflected wave, and the phase shift upon reflection, strongly depend on the wave's angle of incidence and polarization.
The Lempel–Ziv (LZ) compression methods are among the most popular algorithms for lossless storage.

An electromagnetic wave refractor in some aperture antennas is a component which due to its shape and position functions to selectively delay or advance portions of the electromagnetic wavefront passing through it.
Groundwater levels have been dropping, to varying degrees, in many areas of the city, due in part to an increase in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground.
The actual antenna which is transmitting the original wave then also may receive a strong signal from its own image from the ground.
This can be quite a significant effect when the antenna is within a wavelength or two of the ground.
It is one of six cities (along with Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia) to have won championships in all four major sports.

Vertically polarized analog television has nevertheless been used in some rural areas.
If those elements were widely separated and driven in a certain amplitude and phase, then each would act independently as that element is known to.
Note that this now is a near field phenomenon which could not be properly accounted for using the Friis transmission equation for instance.
For receivers near the ground, horizontally polarized transmissions suffer cancellation.
The Emerald Necklace includes Jamaica Pond, Boston's largest body of freshwater, and Franklin Park, the city's largest park and home of the Franklin Park Zoo.
If the integers generated by quantization are 8 bits each, then the entire range of the analog signal is divided into 256 intervals and all the signal values within an interval are quantized to the same number.

Approximately 41% of readers are women.
Flowering plants may have evolved in an isolated setting like an island or island chain, where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal (a wasp, for example).
Such a relationship, with a hypothetical wasp carrying pollen from one plant to another much the way fig wasps do today, could result in the development of a high degree of specialization in both the plant(s) and their partners.

Mainstream AC itself has evolved in a similar fashion over the years; traditional AC artists like Barbra Streisand, the Carpenters, Dionne Warwick, Barry Manilow, John Denver, and Olivia Newton-John found it harder to have major Top 40 hits as the 1980s wore on, and due to the influence of MTV, artists who were staples of the Contemporary Hit Radio format, such as Richard Marx, Michael Jackson, Bonnie Tyler, George Michael, Phil Collins, and Laura Branigan began crossing over to the AC charts with greater frequency.
However, with the combination of MTV and AC radio, adult contemporary appeared harder to define as a genre, with established soft-rock artists of the past still charting pop hits and receiving airplay alongside mainstream radio fare from newer artists at the time.

Others have changed their names over the years such as Beechen Cliff School which was started in 1905 as the City of Bath Boys' School and changed to its present name in 1972 when the grammar school was amalgamated with a local secondary modern school, to form a comprehensive school.
Although they did not fix their schedules to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than modern DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of day length, so that each daylight hour was longer during summer.
For example, Roman water clocks had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes.
Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some Mount Athos monasteries and all Jewish ceremonies.
King's School, Bruton, was founded in 1519 and received royal foundation status around 30 years later in the reign of Edward VI.
Despite common misconception, Franklin did not actually propose DST; 18th-century Europe did not even keep precise schedules.
Modern DST was first proposed by the New Zealand entomologist George Hudson, whose shift-work job gave him leisure time to collect insects, and led him to value after-hours daylight.

There were also parallels in the development of literature and social thought.
There are 75 institutions of higher learning till 2013.
The number of National key laboratories, National key disciplines and the academicians of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering all rank third in the nation.
This new kind of depiction revolutionized the way objects could be visualized in painting and art.
The historical study of Cubism began in the late 1920s, drawing at first from sources of limited data, namely the opinions of Guillaume Apollinaire.
The terms "analytical" and "synthetic" which subsequently emerged have been widely accepted since the mid-1930s.
"If Kahnweiler considers Cubism as Picasso and Braque," wrote Daniel Robbins, "our only fault is in subjecting other Cubists' works to the rigors of that limited definition."
The 2015 season started during the last week of March and ran weekly into late August.
From 2005 to 2008, the games were at neutral sites, Las Vegas and New Orleans.
The situation was difficult for the church, which struggled under Soviet rule.
After the death of Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin took the reins of power and began an era of renewed fear and terror for Armenians.
The AFL played 22 seasons from 1987 to 2008; internal issues caused the league to cancel its 2009 season, though the af2 did play.
His support gave his artists the freedom to experiment in relative privacy.
He reached an agreement with NBC for a "test game".
Peaceful protests in Yerevan supporting the Karabakh Armenians were met with anti-Armenian pogroms in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait.
At the Salon d'Automne of the same year, in addition to the Indépendants group of Salle 41, were exhibited works by André Lhote, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Villon, Roger de La Fresnaye, André Dunoyer de Segonzac and František Kupka.
The exhibition was reviewed in the October 8, 1911 issue of The New York Times.
Interest was high enough following the initial test game that Foster decided to put on a second, "showcase", game.
The war was a success for the Karabakh Armenian forces who managed to capture 16% of Azerbaijan's internationally recognised territory including Nagorno-Karabakh itself.
It was against this background of public anger that Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes wrote Du "Cubisme" (published by Eugène Figuière in 1912, translated to English and Russian in 1913).
The top two teams, Denver and Pittsburgh, then competed in the first-ever AFL championship game, ArenaBowl I.
The patent expired on September 30, 2007.
From the 1987 season until the late 1990s, the most exposure the league would receive was on ESPN, which aired tape-delayed games, often well after midnight, and often edited to match the alloted time slot.
Turkey also has a long history of poor relations with Armenia over its refusal to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide.
The ratification of those had to be made in the national parliaments.
There are a number of franchises which existed in the form of a number of largely-unrelated teams under numerous management groups until they folded (an example is the New York CityHawks whose owners transferred the team from New York to Hartford to become the New England Sea Wolves after two seasons, then after another two seasons were sold and became the Toronto Phantoms, who lasted another two seasons until folding).
According to the US Census Bureau, there are 427,822 Armenians living in the country.
While it was not financially lucrative, it helped set the stage for what the league would become in the new millennium.
This technique of representing simultaneity, multiple viewpoints (or relative motion) is pushed to a high degree of complexity in Gleizes' monumental Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing), exhibited at the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or, Le Fauconnier’s Abundance shown at the Indépendants of 1911, and Delaunay's City of Paris, shown at the Indépendants in 1912.
Cubist sculpture developed in parallel to Cubist painting.
Baker explained, "When I took over as commissioner, I thought it would be for one year.
According to Douglas Cooper: "The first true Cubist sculpture was Picasso's impressive Woman's Head, modeled in 1909–10, a counterpart in three dimensions to many similar analytical and faceted heads in his paintings at the time."
In France, however, Cubism experienced a decline beginning in about 1925.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans.
Following the suspension of the AFL's 2009 season, league officials and owners of af2 (which had played its season as scheduled) began discussing the future of arena football and the two leagues.
The lone exception was that of the Dallas Desperados; Desperados owner Jerry Jones had purposely designed the Desperados' properties around those of the Dallas Cowboys, making the two inseparable.
The influential De Stijl movement embraced the aesthetic principles of Neo-plasticism developed by Piet Mondrian under the influence of Cubism in Paris.
De Stijl was also linked by Gino Severini to Cubist theory through the writings of Albert Gleizes.
On the basis of the expansion and development of Yerevan State University a number of higher educational independent Institutions were formed including Medical Institute separated in 1930 which was set up on the basis of medical faculty.
It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study.
Mkhitar Heratsi was the founder of Armenian Medical school in Cilician Armenia.
"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence", writes Christopher Green, "creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye".
The original Cubist architecture is very rare.
After the war, the architectural style called Rondo-Cubism was developed in Prague fusing the Cubist architecture with round shapes.
The grilles as well as other architectural ornaments attain a three-dimensional form.
Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music.
The San Antonio Talons folded on October 13, 2014, after the league (which owned the team) failed to find a new owner.
They worked mostly in Prague but also in other Bohemian towns.
Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European (especially French) pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 1960s and 1970s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia; also with artists such as Sirusho, performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry.
On September 1, 2015, the Spokane Shock officially left the AFL and joined the IFL under the new name Spokane Empire, becoming the fifth active AFL/af2 franchise to leave for the IFL since bankruptcy (Iowa Barnstormers, Tri-Cities Fever, Green Bay Blizzard and Arkansas Twisters—now the Texas Revolution—left previously).
On January 6, 2016, the league took over "ownership and operational control" of the Portland Thunder from its previous owners.
The league's 2016 schedule, announced on the league's website on December 10, 2015, shows an eight-team league playing a 16-game regular season over 18 weeks, with two bye weeks for each team, one on a rotational basis and the other a "universal bye" for all teams during the Independence Day weekend, the first weekend in July.
Competitively, Armenia has been successful in chess, weightlifting and wrestling at the international level.
It also hosts the Pan-Armenian Games.
The most successful team was the FC Ararat Yerevan team of the 1970s who won the Soviet Cup in 1973 and 1975 and the Soviet Top League in 1973.
The Prime Minister headed the committee of ministers along with head of executive (Maha Amatya).
Due to the lack of success lately on the international level, in recent years, Armenia has rebuilt 16 Soviet-era sports schools and furnished them with new equipment for a total cost of $1.9 million.
The rebuilding of the regional schools was financed by the Armenian government.
This is the first time professional football of any kind will be played in China with the support of the Chinese government and the CRFA (Chinese Rugby Football Association).
Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the City of God (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man (Civitas Terrena).
Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals.
Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust.
There are typically 40 million bacterial cells in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water.
There are approximately 5×1030 bacteria on Earth, forming a biomass which exceeds that of all plants and animals.
Bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients, with many of the stages in nutrient cycles dependent on these organisms, such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction.
The AFL also had a regional-cable deal with FSN, where FSN regional affiliates in AFL markets carried local team games.
In some areas, such as with the Arizona Rattlers, Fox Sports affiliates still carry the games.
It had much in common with the Mutazalite Islamic thinking in that the Roman Catholics though subordinating philosophy to theology did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions, subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam.
The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation.
In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem.
Briefly, the games were broadcast on a tape delay to prevent the embarrassment that would result should the players stage a work stoppage immediately prior to a scheduled broadcast.
Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the Republic of Florence rather than the oligarchy of the di Medici family.
This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of alphaproteobacterial symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes, which are still found in all known Eukarya (sometimes in highly reduced form, e.g.
Later on, some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacterial-like organisms.
EA Sports released another AFL video game, titled Arena Football: Road to Glory, on February 21, 2007, for the PlayStation 2.
There are also some algae that originated from even later endosymbiotic events.
The AFL currently runs as under the single-entity model, with the league owning the rights to the teams, players, and coaches.
However, a few species are visible to the unaided eye — for example, Thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long and Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7 mm.
A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes.
The industrial revolution produced a parallel revolution in political thought.
Bacteria often attach to surfaces and form dense aggregations called biofilms or bacterial mats.
For example, about one in 10 cells migrate to the top of these fruiting bodies and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called myxospores, which are more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions than are ordinary cells.
For example, Standard American English, Standard British English, Standard Canadian English, Standard Indian English, Standard Australian English, and Standard Philippine English may all be said to be standard dialects of the English language.
These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria.
Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice.
Cases may also arise in which a speaker of dialect X can understand a speaker of dialect Y, but not vice versa; the mutual intelligibility criterion flounders here as well.
Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on structuralism and on a "return to Hegel".
Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S (measured in Svedberg units): their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S.
Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis.
The liberal-communitarian debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective.These and other communitarians (such as Alasdair MacIntyre and Daniel A.
By the definition most commonly used by linguists, any linguistic variety can be considered a "dialect" of some language—"everybody speaks a dialect".
A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are republicanism (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the capability approach.
Unlike liberals who understand liberty as "non-interference," "non-domination" entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of anyother person.
An opposite example is the case of Chinese, whose variations such as Mandarin and Cantonese are often called dialects and not languages, despite their mutual unintelligibility.
Modern Nationalism, as developed especially since the French Revolution, has made the distinction between "language" and "dialect" an issue of great political importance.
In most bacteria, a cell wall is present on the outside of the cell membrane.
A common bacterial cell wall material is peptidoglycan (called "murein" in older sources), which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids.
An alloy is distinct from an impure metal, such as wrought iron, in that, with an alloy, the added impurities are usually desirable and will typically have some useful benefit.
The significance of the political factors in any attempt at answering the question "what is a language?"
Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A that is responsible for much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria.
Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement.
Most of them are not mutually intelligible.
If the mixture cools and the constituents become insoluble, they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals, creating a heterogeneous microstructure of different phases.
The main pathogenic bacteria in this class is Mycoplasma (not to be confused with Mycobacteria).
This reflects the modern situation where they are roofed by standard German.
Meteorites are sometimes made of naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel, but are not native to the Earth.
These regional languages are often referred to colloquially or in non-linguistic circles as Italian "dialects," or dialetti (standard Italian for "dialects").
Though mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to which the regional Italian languages are mutual unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages, with some regional Italian languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to each other on the dialect continuum being more or less mutually intelligible.
Some modern superalloys, such as incoloy, inconel, and hastelloy, may consist of a multitude of different components.
In this dormant state, these organisms may remain viable for millions of years, and endospores even allow bacteria to survive exposure to the vacuum and radiation in space.
The economic prowess and cultural and artistic importance of Tuscany in the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance further encouraged the diffusion of the Florentine-Tuscan Italian throughout Italy and among the educated and powerful, though local and regional languages remained the main languages of the common people.
With the eventual spread of the radio and television throughout Italy and the establishment of public education, Italians from all regions were increasingly exposed to standard Italian, while literacy rates among all social classes improved.
Today, the majority of Italians are able to speak standard Italian, though many Italians still speak their regional language regularly or as their primary day-to-day language, especially at home with family or when communicating with Italians from the same town or region.
For instance, sulfur is a common impurity in steel.
Great care is often taken during the alloying process to remove excess impurities, using fluxes, chemical additives, or other methods of extractive metallurgy.
When made from other materials, they are typically specified as such, (i.e.
Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.
Regardless of the type of metabolic process they employ, the majority of bacteria are able to take in raw materials only in the form of relatively small molecules, which enter the cell by diffusion or through molecular channels in cell membranes.
For example, impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura.
In later times bronze has been used for ornaments, bells, statues, and bearings.
Brass is an alloy made from copper and zinc.
The German Empire conquered Ukraine during World War I and was planning on either annexing it or installing a puppet king, but was defeated by the Entente, with major involvement by the Ukrainian Bolsheviks.
After World War II, due to Ukrainian collaborationism with the Axis powers in an attempt to gain independence, Moscow changed its policy towards repression of the Ukrainian language.
Many alloys of aluminium, copper, magnesium, titanium, and nickel can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment, but few respond to this to the same degree that steel does.
Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms.
From the Ming dynasty onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties.
When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly, these alloys become much softer than normal, during the diffusionless transformation, and then harden as they age.

Arrowheads from the Chinese Qin dynasty (around 200 BC) were often constructed with a hard bronze-head, but a softer bronze-tang, combining the alloys to prevent both dulling and breaking during use.
In 1983 the historic old town in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
A bacteriophage can contain genes that contribute to its host's phenotype: for example, in the evolution of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Clostridium botulinum, the toxin genes in an integrated phage converted a harmless ancestral bacterium into a lethal pathogen.

The Bessemer process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel.
The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings.
Of the rest of the land, 23.25 square kilometers (8.98 sq mi) or 45.0% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.06 square kilometers (0.41 sq mi) or 2.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.16 square kilometers (0.062 sq mi) or 0.3% is unproductive land.

A PCB populated with electronic components is called a printed circuit assembly (PCA), printed circuit board assembly or PCB assembly (PCBA).
Starting from the schematic diagram the component pin pads were laid out on the mylar and then traces were routed to connect the pads.
The assemblers often mount components on panels rather than single PCBs because this is efficient.
Only one small tract (5 km2) of rainforest remains, which was declared as the Norfolk Island National Park in 1986.
Some unhappiness with G. H. Nobbs, the more organised and formal ritual of the Church of England service arising from the influence of the Melanesian Mission, decline in spirituality, the influence of visiting American whalers, literature sent by Christians overseas impressed by the Pitcairn story, and the adoption of Seventh-day Adventism by the descendants of the mutineers still on Pitcairn, all contributed to these developments.

The classical period of Greek civilization covers a time spanning from the early 5th century BC to the death of Alexander the Great, in 323 BC (some authors prefer to split this period into 'Classical', from the end of the Persian wars to the end of the Peloponnesian War, and 'Fourth Century', up to the death of Alexander).
In any case, Alexander's toppling of the Achaemenid Empire, after his victories at the battles of the Granicus, Issus and Gaugamela, and his advance as far as modern-day Pakistan and Tajikistan, provided an important outlet for Greek culture, via the creation of colonies and trade routes along the way.
Many Greeks settled in Hellenistic cities like Alexandria, Antioch and Seleucia.
A project that is proceeding is the creation of The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries in the medieval triforium of the abbey.

Thomas Paine penned the Rights of Man in 1791 as a response to Burke; Mary Wollstonecraft published A Vindication of the Rights of Men and James Mackintosh wrote Vindiciae Gallicae.
Mackintosh later agreed with Burke's views, remarking in December 1796 after meeting him, that Burke was "minutely and accurately informed, to a wonderful exactness, with respect to every fact relating to the French Revolution".
Greeks are greatly credited for the European cultural revolution, later called, the Renaissance.
Evidence from fragile states also shows that corruption and bribery can adversely impact trust in institutions.
The Greek speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves Romioi, (as opposed to being so named by others) and, at least those educated, considered their ethnicity (genos) to be Hellenic.
He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of "obscure and vulgar vices" that was not "chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action".
Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: "a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred".

On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son Richard.
King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of £2,500.

The State has dominion and conquest for its sole objects—dominion over minds by proselytism, over bodies by arms".
Burke said: "It is not France extending a foreign empire over other nations: it is a sect aiming at universal empire, and beginning with the conquest of France".
They may be almost exclusively selected from a particular group (for example, Sunni Arabs in Saddam Hussein's Iraq, the nomenklatura in the Soviet Union, or the Junkers in Imperial Germany) that support the regime in return for such favors.
A similar problem can also be seen in Eastern Europe, for example in Romania, where the government is often accused of patronage (when a new government comes to power it rapidly changes most of the officials in the public sector).
Burke believed that property was essential to human life.
They were also called Danuna according to a Hittite inscription and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters.
A milder form of cronyism is an "old boy network", in which appointees to official positions are selected only from a closed and exclusive social network – such as the alumni of particular universities – instead of appointing the most competent candidate.
Concern for property is not Burke's only influence.
The most obvious link between modern and ancient Greeks is their language, which has a documented tradition from at least the 14th century BC to the present day, albeit with a break during the Greek Dark Ages (lasting from the 11th to the 8th century BC).
In his Two Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland Wordsworth called Burke "the most sagacious Politician of his age" whose predictions "time has verified".
He later revised his poem The Prelude to include praise of Burke ("Genius of Burke!
The cultural changes undergone by the Greeks are, despite a surviving common sense of ethnicity, undeniable.
At the same time, the Greeks have retained their language and alphabet, certain values and cultural traditions, customs, a sense of religious and cultural difference and exclusion, (the word barbarian was used by 12th-century historian Anna Komnene to describe non-Greek speakers), a sense of Greek identity and common sense of ethnicity despite the global political and social changes of the past two millennia.

Waves of emigration followed the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, while the population decreased between mid-1974 and 1977 as a result of emigration, war losses, and a temporary decline in fertility.
Today more than two-thirds of the Greek population in Cyprus is urban.
The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved "a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate.

Forty-seven are matai title-holders elected from territorial districts by Samoans; the other two are chosen by non-Samoans with no chiefly affiliation on separate electoral rolls.
The Samoan islands have been produced by vulcanism, the source of which is the Samoa hotspot which is probably the result of a mantle plume.
The economy of Samoa has traditionally been dependent on agriculture and fishing at the local level.
The purpose of these instruments was to address the various forms of corruption (involving the public sector, the private sector, the financing of political activities, etc.)

Saxophones appear in some scores from the late 19th century onwards.
This is in contrast to some other European Leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.

This invention made possible the separation of the composition of a piece of music from its transmission; without written music, transmission was oral, and subject to change every time it was transmitted.
Unlike the papabile cardinals Giacomo Lercaro of Bologna and Giuseppe Siri of Genoa, he was not identified with either the left or right, nor was he seen as a radical reformer.

In its early history, as Rome successfully defended itself against foreign threats in central and then northern Italy, neighboring city-states sought the protection a Roman alliance would bring.
As such, early republican Rome was not an "empire" or "state" in the modern sense, but an alliance of independent city-states (similar to the Greek hegemonies of the same period) with varying degrees of genuine independence (which itself changed over time) engaged in an alliance of mutual self-protection, but led by Rome.
But the defeated city would be weakened (sometimes with outright land concessions) and thus less able to resist Romanizing influences, such as Roman settlers seeking land or trade with the growing Roman confederacy.
In a brief address to a crowd of approximately 20,000 in St. Peters Square on April 18, Montini called the charges "horrible and slanderous insinuations" and appealed for prayers on his behalf.

Exceptions are Greece, where the lesser numbered Slavs scattered there came to be Hellenized (aided in time by more Greeks returning to Greece in the 9th century and the role of the church and administration) and Romania where Slavic people settled en route for present-day Greece, Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria and East Thrace whereby the Slavic population had come to assimilate.
In absence of such current reversal, the motor would brake to a stop.
Gaius then proposed a law which would grant citizenship rights to Rome's Italian allies.
Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors).
On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.
Therefore, DC motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power, speed, and efficiency/wear.

This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called "back electromotive force (emf)".
Catherine McEwing is the current and 578th sherriff.
If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply.
This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load.
The city centre is located between the two rivers.
The brushless wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed (BWRSDF) machine is the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology (i.e., both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port).
The River Itchen runs through the middle of the city and is bridged in several places.

In Auschwitz, which began operating on 14 June 1940, 1.1 million people died.
However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries.
The per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan (US$1,465), a real growth of 8.1% year-on-year.
The tribes had no laws, however, and soon began to make war with one another, prompting them to invite the Varangians back to rule them and bring peace to the region:

Colour broadcasts started at similarly higher resolutions, first with the US NTSC color system in 1953, which was compatible with the earlier monochrome systems and therefore had the same 525 lines of resolution.
The conductors thus hold equal and opposite charges on their facing surfaces, and the dielectric develops an electric field.
In SI units, a capacitance of one farad means that one coulomb of charge on each conductor causes a voltage of one volt across the device.
[citation needed]

Despite efforts made to reduce analog HDTV to about twice the bandwidth of SDTV, these television formats were still distributable only by satellite.
Japan remained the only country with successful public broadcasting of analog HDTV, with seven broadcasters sharing a single channel.
The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown.
Ripple current causes heat to be generated within the capacitor due to the dielectric losses caused by the changing field strength together with the current flow across the slightly resistive supply lines or the electrolyte in the capacitor.
Common for all DVB standards is the use of highly efficient modulation techniques for further reducing bandwidth, and foremost for reducing receiver-hardware and antenna requirements.
This shift in ideology became known as the verv'.

Voltage reversal is encountered in RLC circuits that are under-damped.
The current and voltage reverse direction, forming a harmonic oscillator between the inductance and capacitance.
A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube.
Nevertheless, 29.97i/59.94i is almost universally called 60i, likewise 23.976p is called 24p.
Several solid dielectrics are available, including paper, plastic, glass, mica and ceramic materials.

However, it is susceptible to water absorption, and has been largely replaced by plastic film capacitors.
They are broadly categorized as class 1 dielectrics, which have predictable variation of capacitance with temperature or class 2 dielectrics, which can operate at higher voltage.
The SNES was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland in April 1992 for GB£150, with a German release following a few weeks later.
Most of the PAL region versions of the console use the Japanese Super Famicom design, except for labeling and the length of the joypad leads.
Unfortunately, the use of this technique may be less satisfactory for some solid state equipment, which may be damaged by operation below its normal power range, requiring that the power supply first be isolated from the consuming circuits.
The company continued to carefully review submitted titles, giving them scores using a 40-point scale and allocating Nintendo's marketing resources accordingly.
In the US, residents in the line of sight of television station broadcast antennas can receive free, over the air programming with a television set with an ATSC tuner (most sets sold since 2009 have this).
With these ratings in place, Nintendo decided its censorship policies were no longer needed.
Under transient conditions, the displacement field can be expressed as (see electric susceptibility):
The Japanese and North American machines have the same region chip.
Alternatively, disconnecting one pin of the console's lockout chip will prevent it from locking the console; hardware in later games can detect this situation, so it later became common to install a switch to reconnect the lockout chip as needed.
This content is protected by encryption known as 5C.
All versions of the SNES are predominantly gray, although the exact shade may differ.
Most capacitors have numbers printed on their bodies to indicate their electrical characteristics.
Capacitors are connected in parallel with the power circuits of most electronic devices and larger systems (such as factories) to shunt away and conceal current fluctuations from the primary power source to provide a "clean" power supply for signal or control circuits.
Original versions additionally include a 28-pin expansion port under a small cover on the bottom of the unit and a standard RF output with channel selection switch on the back; the redesigned models output composite video only, requiring an external modulator for RF.
This is used in car audio applications, when a stiffening capacitor compensates for the inductance and resistance of the leads to the lead-acid car battery.
The color can sometimes be restored with UV light and a hydrogen peroxide solution.
People have used wood for millennia for many purposes, primarily as a fuel or as a construction material for making houses, tools, weapons, furniture, packaging, artworks, and paper.
Usually, the values of these capacitors are given not in farads but rather as a reactive power in volt-amperes reactive (var).
While the SNES can address 128 Mbit,[f] only 117.75 Mbit are actually available for cartridge use.
The largest games released (Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean) contain 48 Mbit of ROM data, while the smallest games contain only 2 Mbit.
It also features an ergonomic design by Lance Barr, later used for the NES-102 model controllers, also designed by Barr.
Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark may not be enough to damage the switch but will still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs.
A knot is a particular type of imperfection in a piece of wood; it will affect the technical properties of the wood, usually reducing the local strength and increasing the tendency for splitting along the wood grain, but may be exploited for visual effect.
When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor.
These are called capacitor-start motors, that have relatively high starting torque.
For example, even a seemingly innocuous device such as a disposable-camera flash unit, powered by a 1.5 volt AA battery, has a capacitor which may contain over 15 joules of energy and be charged to over 300 volts.
This is easily capable of delivering a shock.
Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain.
Capacitors may catastrophically fail when subjected to voltages or currents beyond their rating, or as they reach their normal end of life.
Proper containment, fusing, and preventive maintenance can help to minimize these hazards.
Historiography of science, in contrast, often draws on the historical methods of both intellectual history and social history.
Scientific methods are considered to be so fundamental to modern science that some consider earlier inquiries into nature to be pre-scientific.
More recent historical interpretations, such as those of Thomas Kuhn, tend to portray the history of science in different terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science.
The term heartwood derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree.
Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras, while in maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, thick sapwood is the rule.
Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional to the size of the crown of the tree.
If the rings are narrow, more of them are required than where they are wide.
As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume.
However, while Egyptian medicine had some effective practices, it was not without its ineffective and sometimes harmful practices.
A concrete instance of Pythagoras' law was recorded, as early as the 18th century BC: the Mesopotamian cuneiform tablet Plimpton 322 records a number of Pythagorean triplets (3,4,5) (5,12,13).
If a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of soil and site remain unchanged, it will make its most rapid growth in youth, and gradually decline.
In Classical Antiquity, the inquiry into the workings of the universe took place both in investigations aimed at such practical goals as establishing a reliable calendar or determining how to cure a variety of illnesses and in those abstract investigations known as natural philosophy.
The pre-Socratic philosopher Thales (640-546 BC), dubbed the "father of science", was the first to postulate non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena, for example, that land floats on water and that earthquakes are caused by the agitation of the water upon which the land floats, rather than the god Poseidon.
This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood.
Plato founded the Platonic Academy in 387 BC, whose motto was "Let none unversed in geometry enter here", and turned out many notable philosophers.
Some experiments on very resinous Longleaf Pine specimens indicate an increase in strength, due to the resin which increases the strength when dry.
He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes of plants and animals in the world around him, classified more than 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50.
Akkadian and Sumerian coexisted as vernacular languages for about one thousand years, but by around 1800 BC, Sumerian was becoming more of a literary language familiar mainly only to scholars and scribes.
Stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut.
In the Hellenistic age scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of mathematics and deliberate empirical research, in their scientific investigations.
The Sumerian language continued as a sacerdotal language taught in schools in Babylonia and Assyria, much as Latin was used in the Medieval period, for as long as cuneiform was utilized.
In Hellenistic Egypt, the mathematician Euclid laid down the foundations of mathematical rigor and introduced the concepts of definition, axiom, theorem and proof still in use today in his Elements, considered the most influential textbook ever written.
Ordinary sap-staining is due to fungal growth, but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect.

LEDs have also been used as a medium-quality voltage reference in electronic circuits.
The sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a microsequencer, which runs a microcode program that causes all of these events to happen.
Some can only operate on whole numbers (integers) whilst others use floating point to represent real numbers, albeit with limited precision.
Only two other actual non-League clubs have even reached the final since the founding of the League: Sheffield Wednesday in 1890 (champions of the Football Alliance, a rival league which was already effectively the Second Division, which it formally became in 1892 – Wednesday being let straight into the First Division), and Southampton in 1900 and 1902 (in which years they were also Southern League champions, proving the strength of that league: again, they were probably of equivalent standard to a First Division club at the time, but Southampton's form subsequently faded and they did not join the League till 1920 and the formation of the Third Division.)

The effort was funded by ARPA (now DARPA), and the computer network that resulted was called the ARPANET.
These five nations are the only states to have permanent seats with veto power on the UN Security Council.
The Church–Turing thesis is a mathematical statement of this versatility: any computer with a minimum capability (being Turing-complete) is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform.
Japan and Germany are great powers too, though due to their large advanced economies (having the third and fourth largest economies respectively) rather than their strategic and hard power capabilities (i.e., the lack of permanent seats and veto power on the UN Security Council or strategic military reach).
is able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage capacity.
In addition to those contemporary great powers mentioned above, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Malik Mohan consider India to be a great power too.
However, there is no collective agreement among observers as to the status of India, for example, a number of academics believe that India is emerging as a great power, while some believe that India remains a middle power.
Various authors describe Italy as an equal major power, while others view Italy as an "intermittent great power" or as "the least of the great powers".
This is most notable in areas where the European Union has exclusive competence (i.e.

A 1913 report by Sir Baldwin Spencer states that:
Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body.
As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow.

The method takes its name from the word stemma.
This was reinforced by an appreciation, following the trend in sociological thought, of the manner in which the individual is affected by and contributes to the overall social context.
Relations between the lost intermediates are determined by the same process, placing all extant manuscripts in a family tree or stemma codicum descended from a single archetype.
Early Italian synagogues have left few traces; but one was dedicated in Ostia around the mid-1st century BC and several more are attested during the Imperial period.
If it seems that one manuscript is by far the best text, then copy text editing is appropriate, and if it seems that a group of manuscripts are good, then eclecticism on that group would be proper.
Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not.
For example, where there are more than two witnesses at the same level of the tree, normally the critic will select the dominant reading.
McKerrow was aware of the limitations of the stemmatic method, and believed it was more prudent to choose one particular text that was thought to be particularly reliable, and then to emend it only where the text was obviously corrupt.
Valerian's first religious edict singled out Christianity as a particularly self-interested and subversive foreign cult, outlawed its assemblies and urged Christians to sacrifice to Rome's traditional gods.
The first favours a primordialist approach which takes the sense of self and belonging to a collective group as a fixed thing, defined by objective criteria such as common ancestry and common biological characteristics.

While they have been criticized, they continue to exert an influence on approaches to the conceptualisation of identity today.
In 295, a certain Maximilian refused military service; in 298 Marcellus renounced his military oath.
The principle is sound without regard for the literary period."
McKerrow had articulated textual criticism's goal in terms of "our ideal of an author's fair copy of his work in its final state".
Tanselle notes that, "Textual criticism ... has generally been undertaken with a view to reconstructing, as accurately as possible, the text finally intended by the author".
People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with.
The peace of the emperors was the peace of God; as far as the Church was concerned, internal dissent and doctrinal schism were a far greater problem.
Constantine united the empire as an absolute head of state, and on his death, he was honored as a Christian, Imperial, and "divus".
In its application in textual criticism, the text of a number of different manuscripts is entered into a computer, which records all the differences between them.
The difference between cladistics and more traditional forms of statistical analysis is that, rather than simply arranging the manuscripts into rough groupings according to their overall similarity, cladistics assumes that they are part of a branching family tree and uses that assumption to derive relationships between them.
Later, Philostorgius criticized Christians who offered sacrifice at statues of the divus Constantine.
One aspect of that effort entailed digitizing the text and preparing appropriate footnotes, another aspect required establishing the most dependable text.
Many of his observations were included as improvements in the 1981 LDS edition of the Book of Mormon.
In cognitive psychology, the term "identity" refers to the capacity for self-reflection and the awareness of self.
Erikson's work, in the psychodynamic tradition, aimed to investigate the process of identity formation across a lifespan.
He also closely examined the Printer’s Manuscript (owned by the Community of Christ—RLDS Church in Independence, Missouri) for differences in types of ink or pencil, in order to determine when and by whom they were made.
YouTube is a global video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California, United States.
All things being equal, textual scholars expect that a larger time gap between an original and a manuscript means more changes in the text.
Scientific and critical editions can be protected by copyright as works of authorship if enough creativity/originality is provided.
Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party "was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible".

The phonautograph, patented by Léon Scott in 1857, used a vibrating diaphragm and stylus to graphically record sound waves as tracings on sheets of paper, purely for visual analysis and without any intent of playing them back.
Phonautograms of singing and speech made by Scott in 1860 were played back as sound for the first time in 2008.

The biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react.
Behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non-self, a biotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or non-related species, and even filter out "noise", i.e.
The phrase "[A] hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world" was first used by Baptist theologian Roger Williams, the founder of the colony of Rhode Island, in his 1644 book The Bloody Tenent of Persecution.

For instance, programs such as Carnivore and NarusInsight have been used by the FBI and NSA to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers.
Robert S. Wood has argued that the United States is a model for the world in terms of how a separation of church and state—no state-run or state-established church—is good for both the church and the state, allowing a variety of religions to flourish.
Speaking at the Toronto-based Center for New Religions, Wood said that the freedom of conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a "remarkable religiosity" in the United States that isn't present in other industrialized nations.
Smart phones, tablet computers, smart watches, and other mobile devices such as Quantified Self devices like activity trackers have also become targets and many of these have sensors such as cameras, microphones, GPS receivers, compasses, and accelerometers which could be exploited, and may collect personal information, including sensitive health information.

Turner Classic Movies essentially operates as a commercial-free service, with the only advertisements on the network being shown between features – which advertise TCM products, network promotions for upcoming special programs and the original trailers for films that are scheduled to be broadcast on TCM (particularly those that will air during the primetime hours), and featurettes about classic film actors and actresses.
Because of this, TCM is formatted similarly to a premium channel with certain films – particularly those made from the 1960s onward – sometimes featuring nudity, sexual content, violence and/or strong profanity; the network also features rating bumpers prior to the start of a program (most programs on TCM, especially films, are rated for content using the TV Parental Guidelines, in lieu of the MPAA's rating system).

In addition, the large restriction on possible patterns in UTF-8 (for instance there cannot be any lone bytes with the high bit set) means that it should be possible to distinguish UTF-8 from other character encodings without relying on the BOM.
), or whether a date conforms to the Julian calendar (O.S.)
rather than the Gregorian (N.S.
In UTF-32 and UCS-4, one 32-bit code value serves as a fairly direct representation of any character's code point (although the endianness, which varies across different platforms, affects how the code value manifests as an octet sequence).
Unicode also contains precomposed versions of most letter/diacritic combinations in normal use.
This would have greatly reduced the number of required code points, while allowing the display of virtually every conceivable ideograph (which might do away with some of the problems caused by Han unification).
The rules governing ligature formation can be quite complex, requiring special script-shaping technologies such as ACE (Arabic Calligraphic Engine by DecoType in the 1980s and used to generate all the Arabic examples in the printed editions of the Unicode Standard), which became the proof of concept for OpenType (by Adobe and Microsoft), Graphite (by SIL International), or AAT (by Apple).
The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged.
A simple solution to the placement of combining marks or diacritics is assigning the marks a width of zero and placing the glyph itself to the left or right of the left sidebearing (depending on the direction of the script they are intended to be used with).
A mark handled this way will appear over whatever character precedes it, but will not adjust its position relative to the width or height of the base glyph; it may be visually awkward and it may overlap some glyphs.
These products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions.
Although a great deal of text is still stored in legacy encodings, Unicode is used almost exclusively for building new information processing systems.
Further, the credit quality of CDO's declined from 2000 to 2007, as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5% to 36% of CDO assets.
Later in 1752 in September the Gregorian calendar was introduced throughout Britain and the British colonies (see the section Adoption).
In terms of the newline, Unicode introduced U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR and U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR.
In other words, the text system can correctly treat the character as a newline, regardless of the input's actual encoding.
Modern font technology provides a means to address the practical issue of needing to depict a unified Han character in terms of a collection of alternative glyph representations, in the form of Unicode variation sequences.
This choice was supported by a "plausible deniability" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early "vintages" of subprime loans was so low.

The southern German states immediately sided with Prussia.
Firing a contact-detonated shell, the Krupp gun had a longer range and a higher rate of fire than the French bronze muzzle loading cannon, which relied on faulty time fuses.
Douay was killed in the late morning when a caisson of the divisional mitrailleuse battery exploded near him; the encirclement of the town by the Prussians threatened the French avenue of retreat.
Just say, 'This was a horrible disaster and we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'".
At Sony's E3 2010 press conference, Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements, citing Sony's move to make the system more developer friendly, and to announce that Valve would be developing Portal 2 for the system.
The Army of Châlons marched northeast towards the Belgian border to avoid the Prussians before striking south to link up with Bazaine.
TechRadar gave PS3 Slim four and a half stars out of five praising its new smaller size and summed up its review stating "Over all, the PS3 Slim is a phenomenal piece of kit.
A delegation of Parisian diplomats arrived in Tours by train on 5 February to negotiate with Gambetta, and the following day Gambetta stepped down and surrendered control of the provincial armies to the Government of National Defence, which promptly ordered a cease-fire across France.
Other countries quickly discerned the advantages given to the Germans by their military system, and adopted many of their innovations, particularly the General Staff, universal conscription and highly detailed mobilization systems.
Technology magazine T3 gave the Super Slim model a positive review, stating the console is almost "nostalgic" in the design similarities to the original "fat" model, "While we don’t know whether it will play PS3 games or Blu-ray discs any differently yet, the look and feel of the new PS3 Slim is an obvious homage to the original PS3, minus the considerable excess weight.
The Prussian General Staff had drawn up minutely detailed mobilization plans using the railway system, which in turn had been partly laid out in response to recommendations of a Railway Section within the General Staff.
The French railway system, with multiple competing companies, had developed purely from commercial pressures and many journeys to the front in Alsace and Lorraine involved long diversions and frequent changes between trains.
Furthermore, no system had been put in place for military control of the railways, and officers simply commandeered trains as they saw fit.
Immediately we would be concerned about the durability of the top loading tray that feels like it could be yanked straight out off the console, but ultimately it all feels like Sony's nostalgic way of signing off the current generation console in anticipation for the PS4."
The attack was a costly success and came to be known as "von Bredow's Death Ride", which was held to prove that cavalry charges could still prevail on the battlefield.
Use of traditional cavalry on the battlefields of 1914 proved to be disastrous, due to accurate, long-range rifle fire, machine-guns and artillery.
In the Prussian province of Posen, with a large Polish population, there was strong support for the French and angry demonstrations at news of Prussian-German victories—a clear manifestation of Polish nationalist feeling.
Calls were also made for Polish recruits to desert from the Prussian Army—though these went mainly unheeded.
Originally, legislative power was exercised by the sovereign acting on the advice of the Curia Regis, or Royal Council, in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament.
During Henry VI's reign, it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills, which would not become law unless the sovereign's assent was obtained, as the sovereign was, and still remains, the enactor of laws.
Under Marshal Adolphe Niel, urgent reforms were made.
Those who for any reason were not conscripted were to be enrolled in the Garde Mobile, a militia with a nominal strength of 400,000.
During the rule of the succeeding Hanoverian dynasty, power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government.
(A revised version of the proposed reforms was subsequently given assent.)
Franco-German War), often referred to in France as the War of 1870 (19 July 1870 – 10 May 1871), was a conflict between the Second French Empire and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia.
The conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification.
If the Governor General of Canada is unable to give assent, it can be done by either the Deputy of the Governor General of Canada—the Chief Justice of Canada—or another justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.
By afternoon, the Germans had suffered c. 10,500 killed or wounded and the French had lost a similar number of casualties and another c. 9,200 men taken prisoner, a loss of about 50%.
However, it was later discovered that it had not been passed by each house.
The Governor-General revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually passed.
However, the Prussian artillery was superior with the all-steel Krupp breech-loading gun.
French infantry were equipped with the breech-loading Chassepot rifle, one of the most modern mass-produced firearms in the world at the time.
The artillery was equipped with rifled, muzzle-loaded La Hitte guns.
But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield.
The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker.
Nevertheless, the war would continue.
A pre-war plan laid out by the late Marshal Niel called for a strong French offensive from Thionville towards Trier and into the Prussian Rhineland.
General Le Bœuf, flushed with anger, was intent upon going on the offensive over the Saar and countering their loss.
However, planning for the next encounter was more based upon the reality of unfolding events rather than emotion or pride, as Intendant General Wolff told him and his staff that supply beyond the Saar would be impossible.
The Lords Commissioners, as the monarch's representatives are known, wear scarlet parliamentary robes and sit on a bench between the throne and the Woolsack.
Despite access to the armaments factories of Lille, the Army of the North suffered from severe supply difficulties, which depressed morale.
In January 1871, Gambetta forced Faidherbe to march his army beyond the fortresses and engage the Prussians in open battle.
Once blocked from retreat, the French in the fortress of Metz had no choice but to engage in a fight that would see the last major cavalry engagement in Western Europe.
With the defeat of the First Army, Prince Frederick Charles ordered a massed artillery attack against Canrobert's position at St. Privat to prevent the Guards attack from failing too.
At 19:00 the 3rd Division of Fransecky's II Corps of the Second Army advanced across Ravine while the XII Corps cleared out the nearby town of Roncourt and with the survivors of the 1st Guards Infantry Division launched a fresh attack against the ruins of St. Privat.
By 22:00, firing largely died down across the battlefield for the night.
The next morning, the French Army of the Rhine, rather than resume the battle with an attack of its own against the battle-weary German armies, retreated to Metz where they were besieged and forced to surrender two months later.
Before long, the French navy ran short of coal, needing 200 short tons (180 t) per day and having a bunker capacity in the fleet of only 250 short tons (230 t).
If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent.
The French General Staff—along with those of every other European military—was little better than a collection of assistants for the line commanders.
Favre was unaware that the real aim of Bismarck in making such extortionate demands was to establish a durable peace on the new western frontier of Germany, preferably by a peace with a friendly government, on terms acceptable to French public opinion.
By 18:30, a considerable portion of the VII and VIII Corps disengaged from the fighting and withdrew towards the Prussian positions at Rezonville.
The Prussian Army, under the terms of the armistice, held a brief victory parade in Paris on 17 February; the city was silent and draped with black and the Germans quickly withdrew.
Article 92 invests the monarch with the right to call for a referendum, on the advice of the president of the government (commonly referred to in English as the prime minister) and the authorisation of the cortes.
Likewise, in 2010, King Juan Carlos gave royal assent to a law permitting abortion on demand.
On 8 May 1870, shortly before the war, French voters had overwhelmingly supported Napoleon III's program in a national plebiscite, with 7,358,000 votes yes against 1,582,000 votes no, an increase of support of two million votes since the legislative elections in 1869.
Therefore, had Juan Carlos followed the Belgian example in 2005 or 2010, a declaration of incapacity would have transferred power to Felipe, then the heir apparent.
The French Navy lacked the heavy guns to engage the coastal defences and the topography of the Prussian coast made a seaborne invasion of northern Germany impossible.
Groups share a fundamental kinship with the notion of symmetry.
The concept of a group arose from the study of polynomial equations, starting with Évariste Galois in the 1830s.
A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the Siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led naval officers to be sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the Garde Mobile.
As the autumn storms of the North Sea forced the return of more of the French ships, the blockade of the north German ports diminished and in September 1870 the French navy abandoned the blockade for the winter.
The set G is called the underlying set of the group (G, •).
What made a bad situation much worse was the conduct of General Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot, commander of the 1st Division.
Composing two of these symmetry functions gives another symmetry function.
Two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions, that is, applying the first one to the square, and the second one to the result of the first application.
The 19th-century French mathematician Évariste Galois, extending prior work of Paolo Ruffini and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots (solutions).
Its algebraic counterpart, the theory of algebraic groups, was first shaped by Claude Chevalley (from the late 1930s) and later by the work of Armand Borel and Jacques Tits.
On the French side, the units holding St. Privat lost more than half their number in the village.
Prussian gunners strove for a high rate of fire, which was discouraged in the French army in the belief that it wasted ammunition.
Cosets are used to formalize this insight: a subgroup H defines left and right cosets, which can be thought of as translations of H by arbitrary group elements g. In symbolic terms, the left and right cosets of H containing g are
The coset eN = N serves as the identity in this group, and the inverse of gN in the quotient group is (gN)−1 = (g−1)N.e[›]
Forced labour for life was imposed on 251 people, 1,160 people were transported to "a fortified place" and 3,417 people were transported.
For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group.
Large numbers of reservists choked railway stations, vainly seeking rations and orders.
The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole).
This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.
The result of modular addition is the remainder of that division.
The group operation is multiplication modulo p. That is, the usual product is divided by p and the remainder of this division is the result of modular multiplication.
The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen.
Pubertal development also affects circulatory and respiratory systems as an adolescents' heart and lungs increase in both size and capacity.
An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectic state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.
However, the creases in the brain continue to become more complex until the late teens.
Matrix groups consist of matrices together with matrix multiplication.
Development in the limbic system plays an important role in determining rewards and punishments and processing emotional experience and social information.
A group is called finite if it has a finite number of elements.
Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles (e.g., worker or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions.
Some topological spaces may be endowed with a group law.
The former offer an abstract formalism of invariant integrals.
These studies provided the background for Glen Elder in the 1960s, to propose a life-course perspective of adolescent development.
They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space.
The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e.
Consequently, girls who have a high-fat diet and who are not physically active begin menstruating earlier, on average, than girls whose diet contains less fat and whose activities involve fat reducing exercise (e.g.
Girls who experience malnutrition or are in societies in which children are expected to perform physical labor also begin menstruating at later ages.
Adolescents can conceptualize multiple "possible selves" that they could become and long-term possibilities and consequences of their choices.
The table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups.
The first ejaculation of seminal fluid generally occurs about one year after the beginning of accelerated penis growth, although this is often determined culturally rather than biologically, since for many boys first ejaculation occurs as a result of masturbation.
What is today the Central African Republic has been inhabited for millennia; however, the country's current borders were established by France, which ruled the country as a colony starting in the late 19th century.
After gaining independence from France in 1960, the Central African Republic was ruled by a series of autocratic leaders; by the 1990s, calls for democracy led to the first multi-party democratic elections in 1993.
New forms of forced labor were also introduced and a large number of Ubangians were sent to work on the Congo-Ocean Railway.
Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership.
After Boganda's death in a plane crash on 29 March 1959, his cousin, David Dacko, took control of MESAN and became the country's first president after the CAR had formally received independence from France.
Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter.
[citation needed]
The second is the information-processing perspective, which derives from the study of artificial intelligence and attempts to explain cognitive development in terms of the growth of specific components of the thinking process.
The Syrte Agreement in February and the Birao Peace Agreement in April 2007 called for a cessation of hostilities, the billeting of FDPC fighters and their integration with FACA, the liberation of political prisoners, integration of FDPC into government, an amnesty for the UFDR, its recognition as a political party, and the integration of its fighters into the national army.
Michel Djotodia took over as president and in May 2013 Central African Republic's Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye requested a UN peacekeeping force from the UN Security Council and on 31 May former President Bozizé was indicted for crimes against humanity and incitement of genocide.
Some have argued that there may be evolutionary benefits to an increased propensity for risk-taking in adolescence.
Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle.
For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years.
In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best.
Presently, the Central African Republic has active television services, radio stations, internet service providers, and mobile phone carriers; Socatel is the leading provider for both internet and mobile phone access throughout the country.
The U.S. State Department alleged that major human rights abuses such as extrajudicial executions by security forces, torture, beatings and rape of suspects and prisoners occurred with impunity.
Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs.
There is no cure for asthma.
This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity.
The result is classification of the individual into a) identity diffusion in which all children begin, b) Identity Foreclosure in which commitments are made without the exploration of alternatives, c) Moratorium, or the process of exploration, or d) Identity Achievement in which Moratorium has occurred and resulted in commitments.
Many environmental factors have been associated with asthma's development and exacerbation including allergens, air pollution, and other environmental chemicals.
Smoking during pregnancy and after delivery is associated with a greater risk of asthma-like symptoms.
As such, they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys.
Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).
Indeed, coming out in the midst of a heteronormative peer environment often comes with the risk of ostracism, hurtful jokes, and even violence.
Despite changing family roles during adolescence, the home environment and parents are still important for the behaviors and choices of adolescents.
Adolescents who have a good relationship with their parents are less likely to engage in various risk behaviors, such as smoking, drinking, fighting, and/or unprotected sexual intercourse.
Modern day teenagers are exposed to more media on a daily basis than any generation before them.
In children under the age of six the diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry.
Custody disputes soon after a divorce often reflect a playing out of control battles and ambivalence between parents.
It is the single best test for asthma.
In extreme cases of instability and abuse in homes, divorce can have a positive effect on families due to less conflict in the home.
Single-breath diffusing capacity can help differentiate asthma from COPD.
Some examples of social and religious transition ceremonies that can be found in the U.S., as well as in other cultures around the world, are Confirmation, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, Quinceañeras, sweet sixteens, cotillions, and débutante balls.
In other countries, initiation ceremonies play an important role, marking the transition into adulthood or the entrance into adolescence.
Furthermore, transitions into adulthood may also vary by gender, and specific rituals may be more common for males or for females.
Romantic relationships tend to increase in prevalence throughout adolescence.
While asthma is classified based on severity, at the moment there is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system.
Exercise can trigger bronchoconstriction both in people with or without asthma.
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is common in professional athletes.
Culture is learned and socially shared, and it affects all aspects of an individual's life.
Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.
In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.
Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective and thus are not recommended.
Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.
In addition to the sharing of household chores, certain cultures expect adolescents to share in their family's financial responsibilities.
Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care.
Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage.
In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces.
In 1886, F.H.
CAA55 was introduced in 1985 with a total playback capacity per side of 55 minutes 5 seconds, reducing the video capacity to resolve bandwidth issues with the inclusion of Digital Audio.
This process is different for females and males.
The ratio between muscle and fat among post-pubertal boys is around three to one, while for girls it is about five to four.
This may help explain sex differences in athletic performance.
In the mid to late 1990s many higher-end AV receivers included the demodulator circuit specifically for the LaserDisc players RF modulated Dolby Digital AC-3 signal.
The formal study of adolescent psychology began with the publication of G. Stanley Hall's "Adolescence in 1904."
An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development.
So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media.
It was also the first LD player to load from the front and not the top.
An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development.
During its development, MCA, which co-owned the technology, referred to it as the Optical Videodisc System, "Reflective Optical Videodisc" or "Laser Optical Videodisc", depending on the document; changing the name once in 1969 to Disco-Vision and then again in 1978 to DiscoVision (without the hyphen), which became the official spelling.
This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become.
Research shows that relationships have the largest affect over the social development of an individual.
From 1981 until the early 1990s, all properly licensed discs carried the LaserVision name and logo, even Pioneer Artists titles.
Communication with peers increases significantly during adolescence and peer relationships become more intense than in other stages and more influential to the teen, affecting both the decisions and choices being made.
One Universal/Columbia co-production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions, The Electric Horseman, is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson's songs.
LaserDiscs were initially cheaper than videocassettes to manufacture, because they lacked the moving parts and plastic outer shell that are necessary for VHS tapes to work, and the duplication process was much simpler.
Behavioral autonomy encompasses an adolescent's developing ability to regulate his or her own behavior, to act on personal decisions, and to self-govern.
LaserDiscs potentially had a much longer lifespan than videocassettes.
In contrast to the entirely digital DVD, LaserDiscs use only analog video.
This allows the individual to think and reason in a wider perspective.
Because of this, slight dust and scratches on the disc surface can result in read-errors which cause various video quality problems: glitches, streaks, bursts of static, or momentary picture interruptions.
In contrast, the digital MPEG-2 format information used on DVDs has built-in error correction which ensures that the signal from a damaged disc will remain identical to that from a perfect disc right up until the point at which damage to the disc surface is so substantial that it prevents the laser from being able to identify usable data.
(Children younger than age nine often cannot comprehend sarcasm at all.)
This also permits the application of advanced reasoning and logical processes to social and ideological matters such as interpersonal relationships, politics, philosophy, religion, morality, friendship, faith, democracy, fairness, and honesty.
One such problem is "laser lock", where the player reads the same two fields for a given frame over and over again, causing the picture to look frozen as if the movie were paused.
Another significant issue unique to LaserDisc is one involving the inconsistency of playback quality between different makers and models of player.
This model has been contested, and alternate ideas have been explored in recent years.
LaserDiscs were also popular alternatives to videocassettes among movie enthusiasts in the more affluent regions of South East Asia, such as Singapore, due to their high integration with the Japanese export market and the disc-based media's superior longevity compared to videocassette, especially in the humid conditions endemic to that area of the world.
Although the LaserDisc format was supplanted by DVD by the late 1990s, many LD titles are still highly coveted by movie enthusiasts (for example, Disney's Song of the South which is unavailable in the US in any format, but was issued in Japan on LD).
This is largely because there are many films that are still only available on LD and many other LD releases contain supplemental material not available on subsequent DVD versions of those films.
Until the end of 2001, many titles were released on VHS, LD, and DVD in Japan.
It was typical for each disc to start with the disc catalog (a few blank frames) then the video introduction before the rest of the data.
The format's instant-access capability made it possible for a new breed of LaserDisc-based video arcade games and several companies saw potential in using LaserDiscs for video games in the 1980s and 1990s, beginning in 1983 with Sega's Astron Belt.
Developmental Intervention Science (DIS) is a fusion of the literature of both developmental and intervention sciences.
Players and discs were never officially sold in North America, although several distributors imported MUSE discs along with other import titles.
During the video transfer stage, the movie was stored in an anamorphic "squeezed" format.
The research is part of the global Census of Marine Life (CoML) and has disclosed some remarkable findings.
More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of 12,000 km (7,456 mi).
RLV discs, like CRVdisc, are also a WORM technology, and function exactly like a CD-R disc.
The only cosmetic difference between an RLV disc and a regular factory-pressed LaserDiscs is their reflective purple-violet (or blue with some RLV discs) color resulting from the dye embedded in the reflective layer of the disc to make it recordable, as opposed to the silver mirror appearance of regular LDs.
One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole.
The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species.
The main mineral resource known on the continent is coal.
Ireland formally declared itself a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1949, and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year.
Costing $16.3 million, the prefabricated station, which is part of the International Polar Year, was shipped to the South Pole from Belgium by the end of 2008 to monitor the health of the polar regions.
Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: "I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good".
[a] As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth.
The expedition led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny reached a point within 32 km (20 mi) from Queen Maud's Land and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 69°21′28″S 2°14′50″W﻿ / ﻿69.35778°S 2.24722°W﻿ / -69.35778; -2.24722, which became known as the Fimbul ice shelf.
With the ban of CFCs in the Montreal Protocol of 1989, climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.
East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor invertebrates and trilobites flourished in the tropical seas.
Antarctica (US English i/æntˈɑːrktɪkə/, UK English /ænˈtɑːktɪkə/ or /ænˈtɑːtɪkə/ or /ænˈɑːtɪkə/)[Note 1] is Earth's southernmost continent, containing the geographic South Pole.
The Duke and Duchess of York had two children: Elizabeth (called "Lilibet" by the family), and Margaret.
As Edward was unmarried and had no children, Albert was the heir presumptive to the throne.
Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it.
The next day, it passed the External Relations Act, which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties.
Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.
Several governments maintain permanent manned research stations on the continent.
In settling the issue, George's first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title and style "His Royal Highness The Duke of Windsor", but the Letters Patent creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles.
The coastline measures 17,968 km (11,165 mi) and is mostly characterized by ice formations, as the following table shows:
This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family.
On 19 May, George VI personally accepted and approved the Letter of Credence of the new U.S.
They proposed instead that a comprehensive regime to protect the Antarctic environment be negotiated in its place.
They visited the 1939 New York World's Fair and stayed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House and at his private estate at Hyde Park, New York.
In September 1939, Britain and the self-governing Dominions, but not Ireland, declared war on Nazi Germany.
In West Antarctica, coniferous forests dominated through the entire Cretaceous period (146–66 Ma), though southern beech became more prominent towards the end of this period.
After the King's initial dismay over Churchill's appointment of Lord Beaverbrook to the Cabinet, he and Churchill developed "the closest personal relationship in modern British history between a monarch and a Prime Minister".
Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.
Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place as symbols of national resistance.
The Statute of Westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the Dominions into separate sovereign states.
The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the Antarctic Convergence) were British and American sealers who used to spend a year or more on South Georgia, from 1786 onward.
The Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, Jan Smuts, was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit.
The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level.
In 2002, fifty years after his death, the remains of his widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and the ashes of his younger daughter Princess Margaret, who both died that year, were interred in the chapel alongside him.
In the words of Labour Member of Parliament George Hardie, the abdication crisis of 1936 did "more for republicanism than fifty years of propaganda".
A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.
During his reign his people endured the hardships of war, and imperial power was eroded.
However, as a dutiful family man and by showing personal courage, he succeeded in restoring the popularity of the monarchy.
Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the United States of America under the Constitution of 1789, is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established.
Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies.
What differentiates the concept from other multi-level political forms is the characteristic of equality of standing between the two levels of government established.
Tensions between territories can still be found in federalist countries such as Canada and federation as a way to appease and quell military conflict has failed recently in places like Lybia or Iraq, while the formula is simultaneously proposed and dismissed in countries such as Ukraine or Syria.
Africa separated from Antarctica in the Jurassic, around 160 Ma, followed by the Indian subcontinent in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Ma).
First, much of the continent is more than 3,000 m (9,800 ft) above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the troposphere.
The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys.
Brazil is one of the biggest federal governments.
Later, a third tier was added in the form of Panchayats and Municipalities.
The Argentine, British and Chilean claims all overlap, and have caused friction.
Some environmentalists and scientists have made a call for stricter regulations for ships and a tourism quota.
Qantas resumed commercial overflights to Antarctica from Australia in the mid-1990s.
the Dutch and French Communities of Belgium).
The lower house of a federal legislature is usually directly elected, with apportionment in proportion to population, although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of seats.
The post-Imperial nature of Russian subdivision of government changed towards a generally autonomous model which began with the establishment of the USSR (of which Russia was governed as part).
Excavations in and near Agordat in central Eritrea yielded the remains of an ancient pre-Aksumite civilization known as the Gash Group.
28," suggested that both levels of government would exercise authority to the citizens' benefit: "If their [the peoples'] rights are invaded by either, they can make use of the other as the instrument of redress."

In species with well-developed septa, the blood circulates entirely within blood vessels, and the vessels in segments near the front ends of these species are often built up with muscles that act as hearts.
The ensuing Eritrean War for Independence went on for 30 years against successive Ethiopian governments until 1991, when the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), a successor of the ELF, defeated the Ethiopian forces in Eritrea and helped a coalition of Ethiopian rebel forces take control of the Ethiopian Capital Addis Ababa.
Their bodies are covered by a cuticle (outer covering) that does not contain cells but is secreted by cells in the skin underneath, is made of tough but flexible collagen and does not molt – on the other hand arthropods' cuticles are made of the more rigid α-chitin, and molt until the arthropods reach their full size.
Most annelids have closed circulatory systems, where the blood makes its entire circuit via blood vessels.
However, the frontmost and rearmost sections are not regarded as true segments as they do not contain the standard sets of organs and do not develop in the same way as the true segments.
The parapodia ("limbs") of annelids that have them often bear more complex chetae at their tips – for example jointed, comb-like or hooked.
Hence annelids' chetae are structurally different from the setae ("bristles") of arthropods, which are made of the more rigid α-chitin, have a single internal cavity, and are mounted on flexible joints in shallow pits in the cuticle.

Typically they are improved earth roads which are occasionally paved.
The mesothelium may also form radial and circular muscles on the septa, and circular muscles around the blood vessels and gut.
Parts of the mesothelium, especially on the outside of the gut, may also form chloragogen cells that perform similar functions to the livers of vertebrates: producing and storing glycogen and fat; producing the oxygen-carrier hemoglobin; breaking down proteins; and turning nitrogenous waste products into ammonia and urea to be excreted.
Overall, Eritrean cuisine strongly resembles those of neighboring Ethiopia, Eritrean cooking tend to feature more seafood than Ethiopian cuisine on account of their coastal location.
Many polychaetes have a muscular pharynx that can be everted (turned inside out to extend it).

Annelids with blood vessels use metanephridia to remove soluble waste products, while those without use protonephridia.
Later they sink to the sea-floor and metamorphose into miniature adults: the part of the trochophore between the apical tuft and the prototroch becomes the prostomium (head); a small area round the trochophore's anus becomes the pygidium (tail-piece); a narrow band immediately in front of that becomes the growth zone that produces new segments; and the rest of the trochophore becomes the peristomium (the segment that contains the mouth).
While most polychaetes remain of one sex all their lives, a significant percentage of species are full hermaphrodites or change sex during their lives.

During the later stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, and to a lesser extent afterwards, uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons.
Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.
His proof for the existence of God was a variation of the Ontological argument.

light and food) compared to those that cannot predict such availability.
It has therefore been suggested that circadian rhythms put organisms at a selective advantage in evolutionary terms.
The morning loop consists of CCA1 (Circadian and Clock-Associated 1) and LHY (Late Elongated Hypocotyl), which encode closely related MYB transcription factors that regulate circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis, as well as PRR 7 and 9 (Pseudo-Response Regulators.)
This finding and further computational modeling of TOC1 gene functions and interactions suggest a reframing of the plant circadian clock as a triple negative-component repressilator model rather than the positive/negative-element feedback loop characterizing the clock in mammals.
Their interactions result in an interlocked feedback loop of gene products resulting in periodic fluctuations that the cells of the body interpret as a specific time of the day.

One of the earliest sexual orientation classification schemes was proposed in the 1860s by Karl Heinrich Ulrichs in a series of pamphlets he published privately.
These categories directly correspond with the categories of sexual orientation used today: heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual.
(1994) criticized the scale for lumping individuals who are different based on different dimensions of sexuality into the same categories.
Therefore, individuals classified as homosexual in one study might not be identified the same way in another depending on which components are assessed and when the assessment is made making it difficult to pin point who is homosexual and who is not and what the overall prevalence within a population may be.
It is common to distinguish a person's sexuality according to their sexual role (active/passive; insertive/penetrated).
For example, an investigation of a small Brazilian fishing village revealed three sexual categories for men: men who have sex only with men (consistently in a passive role), men who have sex only with women, and men who have sex with women and men (consistently in an active role).
Estonia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, separation of church and state, and individual rights to privacy of belief and religion.
While the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and American Psychiatric Association state that sexual orientation is innate, continuous or fixed throughout their lives for some people, but is fluid or changes over time for others, the American Psychological Association distinguishes between sexual orientation (an innate attraction) and sexual orientation identity (which may change at any point in a person's life).
As a result of this immune effect, alterations in later-born males' prenatal development have been thought to occur.
Refer to the Table below.
From here, the anti-male bodies would then cross the blood/brain barrier (BBB) of the developing fetal brain, altering sex-dimorphic brain structures relative to sexual orientation, causing the exposed son to be more attracted to men over women.
The scale was developed to combat the assumption at the time that people are either heterosexual or homosexual and that these two types represent antitheses in the sexual world.
In some specialties (basic medical studies, veterinary, pharmacy, dentistry, architect-engineer, and a classroom teacher programme) the bachelor's and master's levels are integrated into one unit.
Introduced in Klein's book The Bisexual Option, the KSOG uses a 7-point scale to assess seven different dimensions of sexuality at three different points in an individual's life: past (from early adolescence up to one year ago), present (within the last 12 months), and ideal (what would you choose if it were completely your choice).
If sexual orientation was being assessed based on one's sexual attraction then this individual would be considered homosexual, but her behavior indicates heterosexuality.
The first computer centres were established in the late 1950s in Tartu and Tallinn.
The Protestant work ethic remains a significant cultural staple, and free education is a highly prized institution.
One person may presume knowledge of another person's sexual orientation based upon perceived characteristics, such as appearance, clothing, tone of voice, and accompaniment by and behavior with other people.
The attempt to detect sexual orientation in social situations is known as gaydar; some studies have found that guesses based on face photos perform better than chance.
Estonia won the Eurovision Song Contest in 2001 with the song "Everybody" performed by Tanel Padar and Dave Benton.

It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer AMD.
The North Slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages.
Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs, but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.
The desktop production plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, received US$280 million in incentives from the state and opened in 2005, but ceased operations in November 2010.
Dell's contract with the state required them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions, and they sold the North Carolina plant to Herbalife.
Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's own factories overseas.
On January 8, 2009, Dell announced the closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick, Ireland, with the loss of 1,900 jobs and the transfer of production to its plant in Łodź in Poland.
Elliott argued this structure deeply undervalued EMC's core "EMC II" data storage business, and that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was confusing the market and hindering both companies.
The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is.
Shareholders elect the nine board members at meetings, and those board members who do not get a majority of votes must submit a resignation to the board, which will subsequently choose whether or not to accept the resignation.
Staples, the largest office-supply retailer in the U.S., and Best Buy, the largest electronics retailer in the U.S., became Dell retail partners later that same year.
Starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s, gold rushes in Alaska and the nearby Yukon Territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska.
Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946.
These include elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of "bureaucracy".
Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by Donald Carty, as the company came under an SEC probe for its accounting practices.
Dell also managed some success in taking advantage of its high-touch direct sales heritage to establish close relationships and design solutions for clients.
Alaskan Hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including Sikhs and Jains.
According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75 percent.
It is listed in Greenpeace’s Guide to Greener Electronics that scores leading electronics manufacturers according to their policies on sustainability, climate and energy and how green their products are.
In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1900).
A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price.
Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers.
In 1993, to complement its own direct sales channel, Dell planned to sell PCs at big-box retail outlets such as Wal-Mart, which would have brought in an additional $125 million in annual revenue.
Rollins would soon join Dell full-time and eventually become the company President and CEO.
The Dell Streak was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated OS, numerous bugs, and low resolution screen.
The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell's consumer segment to an operating loss in Q3 2012.
Dell's reputation for poor customer service, since 2002, which was exacerbated as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure, came under increasing scrutiny on the Web.
These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the "Dell Hell" prominent on Internet search engines.
The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from Haines.
The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as "The Railbelt".
The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains.
The value of VMware stock fell 10% after the announcement, valuing the deal at around $63–64bn rather than the $67bn originally reported.
Anchorage and, to a lesser extent Fairbanks, is served by many major airlines.
Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2012-2013, Alaska received almost 2 million visitors).
Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the Essential Air Service program.
The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state.
In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation.
Dell began manufacturing in Limerick in 1991 and went on to become Ireland's largest exporter of goods and its second-largest company and foreign investor.
Subsidies from the Polish government did keep Dell for a long time.
Dell's 3.6% growth paled in comparison to HP's 15% growth during the same period.
The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.
Of Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place.
Later in the year, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150 million.
Despite significant investment in this space, Dell continues to face public scrutiny with even the company's own website littered with complaints regarding the issue escalation process.
An appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not.
In 1932 an expedition set out from MGM's studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as "The Biggest Picture Ever Made."
In recent times, however, prisoners have postponed execution through a final round of federal litigation using the Civil Rights Act of 1871 — codified at 42 U.S.C.
§ 1983 — which allows people to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights.
Popper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method, in favour of empirical falsification: A theory in the empirical sciences can never be proven, but it can be falsified, meaning that it can and should be scrutinized by decisive experiments.
The first use of the electric chair after the moratorium was the electrocution of John Spenkelink in Florida on May 25, 1979.
Karl Popper was born in Vienna (then in Austria-Hungary) in 1902, to upper middle-class parents.
Among them, Alabama has the highest per capita rate of death sentences.
After that he did voluntary service in one of psychoanalyst Alfred Adler's clinics for children.
279 § 60, required executions to take place "within an enclosure or building."
He retired from academic life in 1969, though he remained intellectually active for the rest of his life.
As of November 2008, there is only one person on death row facing capital punishment who has not been convicted of murder.
Popper won many awards and honours in his field, including the Lippincott Award of the American Political Science Association, the Sonning Prize, the Otto Hahn Peace Medal of the United Nations Association of Germany in Berlin and fellowships in the Royal Society, British Academy, London School of Economics, King's College London, Darwin College, Cambridge, and Charles University, Prague.
(If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.)
Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state.
Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review.
Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death.
Prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling.
He also held that scientific theory, and human knowledge generally, is irreducibly conjectural or hypothetical, and is generated by the creative imagination to solve problems that have arisen in specific historico-cultural settings.
(However, the United States government executed Tony Chebatoris at the Federal Correctional Institution in Milan, Michigan in 1938.)
To say that a given statement (e.g., the statement of a law of some scientific theory) -- [call it "T"] -- is "falsifiable" does not mean that "T" is false.
In 2004, a constitutional amendment proposed to allow capital punishment in some circumstances failed to make it on the November ballot after a resolution failed in the legislature and a public initiative failed to gather enough signatures.
Again, in this context the word "falsified" does not refer to something being "fake"; rather, that something can be (i.e., is capable of being) shown to be false by observation or experiment.
Until that day, there is no need to reject the assumption that the theory is true.
He writes, "there are no such things as good positive reasons; nor do we need such things [...] But [philosophers] obviously cannot quite bring [themselves] to believe that this is my opinion, let alone that it is right" (The Philosophy of Karl Popper, p. 1043)
However, when given a choice between the death penalty and life imprisonment without parole, support has traditionally been significantly lower than polling which has only mentioned the death penalty as a punishment.
In 2010, for instance, one poll showed 49 percent favoring the death penalty and 46 percent favoring life imprisonment while in another 61% said they preferred another punishment to the death penalty.
Popper writes of learning in 1935 of the consequences of Tarski's theory, to his intense joy.
The theory met critical objections to truth as correspondence and thereby rehabilitated it.
Statistics likely understate the actual problem of wrongful convictions because once an execution has occurred there is often insufficient motivation and finance to keep a case open, and it becomes unlikely at that point that the miscarriage of justice will ever be exposed.
Texas gave 2 percent of murderers a death sentence, less than the national average.
He identifies Tarski's formulation of the truth conditions of sentences as the introduction of a "metalinguistic predicate" and distinguishes the following cases:
The intuitive idea behind verisimilitude is that the assertions or hypotheses of scientific theories can be objectively measured with respect to the amount of truth and falsity that they imply.
And, in this way, one theory can be evaluated as more or less true than another on a quantitative basis which, Popper emphasises forcefully, has nothing to do with "subjective probabilities" or other merely "epistemic" considerations.
The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One.
Although beheading was a legal method in Utah from 1851 to 1888, it was never used.
Popper understood the universe as a creative entity that invents new things, including life, but without the necessity of something like a god, especially not one who is pulling strings from behind the curtain.
Instead, he formulated the spearhead model of evolution, a version of genetic pluralism.
According to this model, living organisms themselves have goals, and act according to these goals, each guided by a central control.
For example, according to this hypothesis, the eating habits of the giraffe must have changed before its elongated neck evolved.
Raven when, in his Science, Religion, and the Future, 1943, he calls this conflict "a storm in a Victorian tea-cup"; though the force of this remark is perhaps a little impaired by the attention he pays to the vapours still emerging from the cup—to the Great Systems of Evolutionist Philosophy, produced by Bergson, Whitehead, Smuts, and others."
Some forms of atheism are arrogant and ignorant and should be rejected, but agnosticism—to admit that we don't know and to search—is all right.
However, the moment I even speak of it, I am embarrassed that I may do something wrong to God in talking about God."
Freedam's statistics looks at the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed, while the others look only at cases not reversed prior to habeas corpus review.
The last use of the gallows between 1608 and the moratorium was when Kansas hanged George York on June 22, 1965.
Due to the slow process of appeals, it was highly unusual for a condemned person to be under 18 at the time of execution.
Twenty-one were 17 at the time of the crime.
In 2015, the state approved nitrogen asphyxiation as a method of execution.
Sixteen was held to be the minimum permissible age in the 1988 Supreme Court decision of Thompson v. Oklahoma.
The Court, considering the case Roper v. Simmons in March 2005, found the execution of juvenile offenders unconstitutional by a 5–4 margin, effectively raising the minimum permissible age to 18.
According to John N. Gray, Popper held that "a theory is scientific only in so far as it is falsifiable, and should be given up as soon as it is falsified."
When they were first advanced, Gray claims, each of them was "at odds with some available evidence; only later did evidence become available that gave them crucial support."
Against this, Gray seeks to establish the irrationalist thesis that "the progress of science comes from acting against reason."
French historians traditionally place the Enlightenment between 1715, the year that Louis XIV died, and 1789, the beginning of the French Revolution.
It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass.
Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music.
For Locke the law of nature is grounded on mutual security, or the idea that one cannot infringe on another's natural rights, as every man is equal and has the same inalienable rights.
Locke also argued against slavery on the basis that enslaving yourself goes against the law of nature; you cannot surrender your own rights, your freedom is absolute and no one can take it from you.
Additionally, Locke argues that one person cannot enslave another because it is morally reprehensible, although he introduces a caveat by saying that enslavement of a lawful captive in time of war would not go against one's natural rights.
There is usually one or more sound holes in the soundboard, either round, oval, or shaped like a calligraphic F (f-hole).
There is confusion currently as to the name of the eldest Vinaccia luthier who first ran the shop.
His name has been put forth as Gennaro Vinaccia (active c. 1710 to c. 1788) and Nic.
Vinaccia.
European roundbacks commonly use a 13-inch scale instead of the 13.876 common on archtop Mandolins.
Samuel Adelstein described the Lombardi mandolin in 1893 as wider and shorter than the Neapolitan mandolin, with a shallower back and a shorter and wider neck, with six single strings to the regular mandolin's set of 4.
Harris' book avoided theological and biographical entries; instead it concentrated on science and technology.
Published in 1704, the Lexicon technicum was the first book to be written in English that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial arithmetic along with the physical sciences and navigation.
The F-5's more complicated woodwork also translates into a more expensive instrument.
Numerous modern mandolin makers build instruments that largely replicate the Gibson F-5 Artist models built in the early 1920s under the supervision of Gibson acoustician Lloyd Loar.
His A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy was published by subscription.
Some notable modern American carved mandolin manufacturers include, in addition to Kay, Gibson, Weber, Monteleone and Collings.
Skinner began teaching part-time at age 18, until the Great Depression forced him to begin teaching full-time and learn a broader range of instruments.
According to Cowan, "the coffeehouse was a place for like-minded scholars to congregate, to read, as well as learn from and to debate with each other, but was emphatically not a university institution, and the discourse there was of a far different order than any university tutorial."
It expanded rapidly during the Age of Enlightenment, reaching practically every country in Europe.
Mary Wollstonecraft was one of England's earliest feminist philosophers.

Paris had dozens of "estudiantina" mandolin orchestras in the early 1900s.
Contrastingly, Rousseau's conception relies on the supposition that "civil man" is corrupted, while "natural man" has no want he cannot fulfill himself.
Rousseau said that people join into civil society via the social contract to achieve unity while preserving individual freedom.
More enduring were the cultural achievements, which created a nationalist spirit in Poland.
Antonio Maria Bononcini composed La conquista delle Spagne di Scipione Africano il giovane in 1707 and George Frideric Handel composed Alexander Balus in 1748.
Rising efficiency in production techniques and communication lowered the prices of consumer goods and increased the amount and variety of goods available to consumers (including the literature essential to the public sphere).
As the economy and the middle class expanded, there was an increasing number of amateur musicians.
It has also been used by other British rock musicians.
There was generally low demand for English publications on the Continent, which was echoed by England's similar lack of desire for French works.
Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin.
Similarly, a significant number of women participated – and won – the competitions.
The Café Procope was established in Paris in 1686; by the 1720s there were around 400 cafés in the city.
The Café Procope was where Diderot and D'Alembert decided to create the Encyclopédie.
During the Age of Enlightenment, Freemasons comprised an international network of like-minded men, often meeting in secret in ritualistic programs at their lodges.
Freemasonry as a systematic creed with its own myths, values and set of rituals originated in Scotland around 1600 and spread first to England and then across the Continent in the eighteenth century.
At the time, Partee was using an imported French-made mandolin.
The Freemasons displayed a passion for secrecy and created new degrees and ceremonies.
Locke is known for his statement that individuals have a right to "Life, Liberty and Property", and his belief that the natural right to property is derived from labor.
Other names include Valentine Abt, Samuel Adelstein, William Place, Jr., and Aubrey Stauffer.
Le Gazetier cuirassé by Charles Théveneau de Morande was a prototype of the genre.
Masonic lodges created a private model for public affairs.
British lodges assigned themselves the duty to "initiate the unenlightened".
In fact, many lodges praised the Grand Architect, the masonic terminology for the deistic divine being who created a scientifically ordered universe.
Together, Steele and Addison published The Spectator (1711), a daily publication which aimed, through fictional narrator Mr. Spectator, both to entertain and to provoke discussion regarding serious philosophical matters.
The Enlightenment was marked by increasing empiricism, scientific rigor, and reductionism, along with increased questioning of religious orthodoxy.
According to his principle of the social contract, Locke said that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control.
Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time.
Some species, such as water striders, are capable of walking on the surface of water.
However, demand for reading material extended outside of the realm of the commercial, and outside the realm of the upper and middle classes, as evidenced by the Bibliothèque Bleue.
A few parasitic species are pathogenic.
In some cultures, people eat the larvae or adults of certain insects.
Academies demonstrate the rising interest in science along with its increasing secularization, as evidenced by the small number of clerics who were members (13 percent).
Pliny the Elder introduced the Latin designation as a loan-translation of the Greek word ἔντομος (éntomos) or "insect" (as in entomology), which was Aristotle's term for this class of life, also in reference to their "notched" bodies.
Translations of Aristotle's term also form the usual word for "insect" in Welsh (trychfil, from trychu "to cut" and mil, "animal"), Serbo-Croatian (zareznik, from rezati, "to cut"), Russian (насекомое nasekomoje, from seč'/-sekat', "to cut"), etc.
This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles (two articulations in the mandible), a feature associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time.
Coevolution has led to the development of very specific mutualisms in such systems.
Science came to play a leading role in Enlightenment discourse and thought.
The Thysanura themselves possibly are not monophyletic, with the family Lepidotrichidae being a sister group to the Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining Thysanura).
The experiments of Lavoisier were used to create the first modern chemical plants in Paris, and the experiments of the Montgolfier Brothers enabled them to launch the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783, from the Château de la Muette, near the Bois de Boulogne.
The recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders Mallophaga and Anoplura are derived from within Psocoptera has led to the new taxon Psocodea.
The Enlightenment has been frequently linked to the French Revolution of 1789.
The Neuropterida are often lumped or split on the whims of the taxonomist.
Clearly a governance philosophy where the king was never wrong was in direct conflict with one whereby citizens by natural law had to consent to the acts and rulings of their government.
The national Enlightenment differed from its Western European counterpart in that it promoted further modernization of all aspects of Russian life and was concerned with attacking the institution of serfdom in Russia.
The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings.
The thorax is a tagma composed of three sections, the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax.
The anterior segment, closest to the head, is the prothorax, with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum.
In 1783, Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn referred to Enlightenment as a process by which man was educated in the use of reason.
Jefferson's political ideals were greatly influenced by the writings of John Locke, Francis Bacon, and Isaac Newton whom he considered the three greatest men that ever lived.
Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites.
Habermas said that the public sphere was bourgeois, egalitarian, rational, and independent from the state, making it the ideal venue for intellectuals to critically examine contemporary politics and society, away from the interference of established authority.
He instead focuses on the history of ideas in the period from 1650 to the end of the 18th century, and claims that it was the ideas themselves that caused the change that eventually led to the revolutions of the latter half of the 18th century and the early 19th century.
Across continental Europe, but in France especially, booksellers and publishers had to negotiate censorship laws of varying strictness.
The thoracic segments have one ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment.
This arrangement is also seen in the abdomen but only in the first eight segments.
The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice.
Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself.
But many works were sold without running into any legal trouble at all.
In some insects, the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary.
The works were part of an Enlightenment movement to systematize knowledge and provide education to a wider audience than the elite.
The massive work was arranged according to a "tree of knowledge."
The tree reflected the marked division between the arts and sciences, which was largely a result of the rise of empiricism.
Both areas of knowledge were united by philosophy, or the trunk of the tree of knowledge.
The Enlightenment's desacrilization of religion was pronounced in the tree's design, particularly where theology accounted for a peripheral branch, with black magic as a close neighbour.
They can produce glue and protective substances for coating eggs or tough coverings for a batch of eggs called oothecae.
Spermathecae are tubes or sacs in which sperm can be stored between the time of mating and the time an egg is fertilized.
It was founded by a group of independent scientists and given a royal charter in 1662.
The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining.
Historian Margaret Jacob stresses the importance of the Masons in indirectly inspiring enlightened political thought.
Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and diffusive ventilation, to discontinuous gas exchange.
For Porset, the avoidance of thematic and hierarchical systems thus allows free interpretation of the works and becomes an example of egalitarianism.
As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies.
In summer, aphids are generally female and parthenogenetic; in the autumn, males may be produced for sexual reproduction.
This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like).
The "Slow" button did not work with games that had a pause menu or pause screen and can interfere with jumping and shooting.
Other accessories include the Power Pad and the Power Glove, which was featured in the movie The Wizard.
Most of this region saw a 1986 release.
Not until the 1990s did Nintendo's newly created European branch direct distribution throughout Europe.
Many species have acute vision capable of detecting minute movements.
Unlike Atari, which never actively courted third-party developers (and even went to court in an attempt to force Activision to cease production of Atari 2600 games), Nintendo had anticipated and encouraged the involvement of third-party software developers; strictly, however, on Nintendo's terms.
In order to combat unlicensed games, Nintendo of America threatened retailers who sold them with losing their supply of licensed titles.
and abbreviated as FC) on July 15, 1983, and was later released in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986, and Australia in 1987.
Some species use vibrations for communicating within members of the same species, such as to attract mates as in the songs of the shield bug Nezara viridula.
Alternatively, the console would turn on but only show a solid white, gray, or green screen.
Users attempted to solve this problem by blowing air onto the cartridge connectors, inserting the cartridge just far enough to get the ZIF to lower, licking the edge connector, slapping the side of the system after inserting a cartridge, shifting the cartridge from side to side after insertion, pushing the ZIF up and down repeatedly, holding the ZIF down lower than it should have been, and cleaning the connectors with alcohol.
These attempted solutions often became notable in their own right and are often remembered alongside the NES.
By the beginning of 1985, the Famicom had sold more than 2.5 million units in Japan and Nintendo soon announced plans to release it in North America as the Advanced Video Entertainment System (AVS) that same year.
The American video game press was skeptical that the console could have any success in the region, with the March 1985 issue of Electronic Games magazine stating that "the videogame market in America has virtually disappeared" and that "this could be a miscalculation on Nintendo's part."
In this communication system, called dance language, the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun, and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown.
Only insects which live in nests or colonies demonstrate any true capacity for fine-scale spatial orientation or homing.
In a phenomenon known as philopatry, insects that hibernate have shown the ability to recall a specific location up to a year after last viewing the area of interest.
Although most hardware clones were not produced under license by Nintendo, certain companies were granted licenses to produce NES-compatible devices.
Production and software revision codes were imprinted as stamps on the back label to correspond with the software version and producer.
With the exception of The Legend of Zelda and Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, manufactured in gold-plastic carts, all licensed NTSC and PAL cartridges are a standard shade of gray plastic.
Nintendo was accused of antitrust behavior because of the strict licensing requirements.
It was soon followed by iNES, which was available in English and was cross-platform, in 1996.
The Virtual Console for the Wii, Nintendo 3DS and Wii U also offers emulation of many NES games.
The original NES (but not the top-loading NES-101) contained the 10NES lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers.
Known regions are: USA/Canada (3193 lockout chip), most of Europe (3195), Asia (3196) and UK, Italy and Australia (3197).
Following a series of arcade game successes in the early 1980s, Nintendo made plans to create a cartridge-based console called the Famicom.
Masayuki Uemura designed the system.
Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate.
Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death (catalepsy), where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period.
The video game market crash of 1983 had occurred in significant part due to a lack of consumer and retailer confidence in video games, which had in turn been due partially to confusion and misrepresentation in the marketing of video games.
Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera.
Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model).
The Challenge Set of 1992 included the console, two controllers, and a Super Mario Bros. 3 Game Pak for a retail price of US$89.99.
Others have been produced with certain specialized markets in mind, such as an NES clone that functions as a rather primitive personal computer, which includes a keyboard and basic word processing software.
These unauthorized clones have been helped by the invention of the so-called NES-on-a-chip.
However, Tengen also obtained a description of the lockout chip from the United States Patent and Trademark Office by falsely claiming that it was required to defend against present infringement claims in a legal case.
Some insects, like wasps, bees, butterflies and ants, pollinate flowering plants.
Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects.
As insects gather nectar from different plants of the same species, they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed.
While birds are perhaps more visible predators of insects, insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption.
Nintendo entered into negotiations with Atari to release the Famicom under Atari’s name as the name Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System.
D. melanogaster has been an essential part of studies into principles like genetic linkage, interactions between genes, chromosomal genetics, development, behavior and evolution.
The second controller lacked the START and SELECT buttons, but featured a small microphone.
In the case of the 'San' bush-men of the Kalahari, it is the praying mantis which holds much cultural significance including creation and zen-like patience in waiting.
While some researchers sometimes use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits, others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive or simplistic way,[page needed] and argue that, among humans, race has no taxonomic significance by pointing out that all living humans belong to the same species, Homo sapiens, and subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens.
While race is understood to be a social construct by many, most scholars agree that race has real material effects in the lives of people through institutionalized practices of preference and discrimination.
Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983.
In a recent trend, many sites have sprung up to offer Nintendo repair parts, guides, and services that replace those formerly offered by the authorized repair centers.
Conversely, the North American re-released NES-101 model most closely resembled the original HVC-001 model Famicom, in that it featured RF modulator output only.
Brutal conflicts between ethnic groups have existed throughout history and across the world.
In particular, the Dendy (Russian: Де́нди), an unlicensed hardware clone produced in Taiwan and sold in the former Soviet Union, emerged as the most popular video game console of its time in that setting and it enjoyed a degree of fame roughly equivalent to that experienced by the NES/Famicom in North America and Japan.
A Famicom clone was marketed in Argentina under the name of "Family Game", resembling the original hardware design.
The Micro Genius (Simplified Chinese: 小天才) was marketed in Southeast Asia as an alternative to the Famicom; Samurai was the popular PAL alternative to the NES; and in Central Europe, especially Poland, the Pegasus was available.
1, Ch XVII: On the death of Alexander, five months after the termination of the Council of Nice, Athanasius was unanimously elected to fill the vacant see.
George, the usurping Bishop, was flung into prison and murdered.
But the saint seems to have divined what was preparing in secret against him.
Rufinus relates a story that as Bishop Alexander stood by a window, he watched boys playing on the seashore below, imitating the ritual of Christian baptism.
According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander "invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary.

It appears that Arius reproached Alexander for what he felt were misguided or heretical teachings being taught by the bishop.
Support for Arius from powerful bishops like Eusebius of Caesarea and Eusebius of Nicomedia, further illustrate how Arius's subordinationist Christology was shared by other Christians in the Empire.
Shortly thereafter, Athanasius became occupied with the theological disputes against Arians within the Byzantine Empire that would occupy much of his life.
Another way to look at differences between populations is to measure genetic differences rather than physical differences between groups.
At this great gathering of prelates, leaders of the Church, the case of Athanasius was taken up once more, that is, Athanasius was formally questioned over misdemeanours and even murder, (a man called Arsenius and using his body for magic, – an absurd charge.).
The Eusebians, seeing they had no chance of having their views carried, retired to Philoppopolis in Thrace, Philippopolis (Thracia), where they held an opposition council, under the presidency of the Patriarch of Antioch, and confirmed the decrees of the Synod of Antioch.

Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper "Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races".
They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity.
Constantius, renewing his previous policies favoring the Arians, banished Athanasius from Alexandria once again.
1, Ch XVII: The Arians sought the approval of an Ecumenical Council.

A "Homoeon" creed was adopted, declaring The Son to be "like the Father".
Acacius, the leader of the "Homoean" party went to Constantinople, where the Sirmian formulary of faith was approved by the "Home Synod", (consisted of those bishops who happened to be present at the Court for the time), and a decree of deposition issued against the leaders of the semi-Arians.
The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled.
When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different.
Each is also associated with opposing ontological consequences vis-a-vis the metaphysics of race.
Upon examining the data from the genome mapping, Venter realized that although the genetic variation within the human species is on the order of 1–3% (instead of the previously assumed 1%), the types of variations do not support notion of genetically defined races.
Over a dozen racial categories would be recognized in conformity with all the possible combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color.
Fluidity of racial categories aside, the "biologification" of race in Brazil referred above would match contemporary concepts of race in the United States quite closely, though, if Brazilians are supposed to choose their race as one among, Asian and Indigenous apart, three IBGE's census categories.
On 6 November, both sides of the dispute met with Emperor Constantine I in Constantinople.
From the last decades of the Empire until the 1950s, the proportion of the white population increased significantly while Brazil welcomed 5.5 million immigrants between 1821 and 1932, not much behind its neighbor Argentina with 6.4 million, and it received more European immigrants in its colonial history than the United States.
Frances A. M. Forbes writes that when the Patriarch Alexander was on his death-bed he called Athanasius, who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made Bishop.

The authors of the study also examined 77 college textbooks in biology and 69 in physical anthropology published between 1932 and 1989.
Up until then, various similar lists of works to be read in churches were in use.
Athanasius includes the Book of Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah and places the Book of Esther among the "7 books not in the canon but to be read" along with the Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Judith, Tobit, the Didache, and the Shepherd of Hermas.
More indirect and brief discussions of race in the context of medical disorders have increased from none to 93% of textbooks.
Some studies have found that patients are reluctant to accept racial categorization in medical practice.
In addition, non-Homoousian bishops disagreed with being labeled as followers of Arius, since Arius was merely a presbyter, while they were fully ordained bishops.
