There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees.
The onus is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, they are never invited.
While heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, for cyclic processes of practical interest in heat engines the second law of thermodynamics states that the system doing work always loses some energy as waste heat.

Objections to banning the use of incandescent light bulbs include the higher initial cost of alternatives and lower quality of light of fluorescent lamps.
However, even though they contain mercury, the environmental performance of CFLs is much better than that of light bulbs, mostly because they consume much less energy and therefore strongly reduce the environmental impact of power production.
But as Hohoff saw it, the manuscript was by no means fit for publication.

The process required pressing tungsten powder into bars, then several steps of sintering, swaging, and then wire drawing.
It is the largest and southernmost of the Mariana Islands, and the largest island in Micronesia.
Small variations in resistivity along the filament cause "hot spots" to form at points of higher resistivity; a variation of diameter of only 1% will cause a 25% reduction in service life.
These hot spots evaporate faster than the rest of the filament, which increases the resistance at that point—this creates a positive feedback that ends in the familiar tiny gap in an otherwise healthy-looking filament.
During the Spanish–American War, the United States captured Guam on June 21, 1898.

Guam was transferred to U.S. Navy control on 23 December 1898 by Executive Order 108-A.
This is measured in watts and depends mainly on the resistance of the filament, which in turn depends mainly on the filament's length, thickness, and material.

Guam is the closest land mass to the Mariana Trench, a deep subduction zone, that lies beside the island chain to the east.
The island of Guam is 30 miles (50 km) long and 4 to 12 miles (6 to 19 km) wide, 3⁄4 the size of Singapore.

Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base.
The weather is generally very warm and humid with little seasonal temperature variation.
Bayonet base lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration.
This means that a 5% reduction in operating voltage will more than double the life of the bulb, at the expense of reducing its light output by about 16%.
These influences are manifested in the local language, music, dance, sea navigation, cuisine, fishing, games (such as batu, chonka, estuleks, and bayogu), songs and fashion.

Growing scientific recognition of the role of private lands for endangered species recovery and the landmark 1981 court decision in Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources both contributed to making Habitat Conservation Plans/ Incidental Take Permits "a major force for wildlife conservation and a major headache to the development community", wrote Robert D.Thornton in the 1991 Environmental Law article, Searching for Consensus and Predictability: Habitat Conservation Planning under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
He claims that the term "operates as a catch-all to lump together disparate laws [which] originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues" and that it creates a "bias" by confusing these monopolies with ownership of limited physical things, likening them to "property rights".

A HDI below 0.5 is considered to represent "low development".
Aristotle believed that no void could occur naturally, because the denser surrounding material continuum would immediately fill any incipient rarity that might give rise to a void.
In his Physics, book IV, Aristotle offered numerous arguments against the void: for example, that motion through a medium which offered no impediment could continue ad infinitum, there being no reason that something would come to rest anywhere in particular.
Eventually following Stoic physics in this instance, scholars from the 14th century onward increasingly departed from the Aristotelian perspective in favor of a supernatural void beyond the confines of the cosmos itself, a conclusion widely acknowledged by the 17th century, which helped to segregate natural and theological concerns.
A HDI of 0.8 or more is considered to represent "high development".

Stars, planets, and moons keep their atmospheres by gravitational attraction, and as such, atmospheres have no clearly delineated boundary: the density of atmospheric gas simply decreases with distance from the object.
Astrophysicists prefer to use number density to describe these environments, in units of particles per cubic centimetre.

However a log-periodic dipole array consists of a number of dipole elements of different lengths in order to obtain a somewhat directional antenna having an extremely wide bandwidth: these are frequently used for television reception in fringe areas.
On the other hand, a superficially similar dipole array, the Yagi-Uda Antenna (or simply "Yagi"), has only one dipole element with an electrical connection; the other so-called parasitic elements interact with the electromagnetic field in order to realize a fairly directional antenna but one which is limited to a rather narrow bandwidth.

Resonant antennas usually use a linear conductor (or element), or pair of such elements, each of which is about a quarter of the wavelength in length (an odd multiple of quarter wavelengths will also be resonant).
Antennas that are required to be small compared to the wavelength sacrifice efficiency and cannot be very directional.
In America, nonprofit organizations like Friends of UNFPA (formerly Americans for UNFPA) worked to compensate for the loss of United States federal funding by raising private donations.
The conductor, or element, is aligned with the electrical field of the desired signal, normally meaning it is perpendicular to the line from the antenna to the source (or receiver in the case of a broadcast antenna).

In June 1986, Madonna released her third studio album, True Blue, which was inspired by and dedicated to Sean Penn.
On January 9, 1957, Karachay Autonomous Oblast and Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic were restored by Khrushchev and they were transferred from the Georgian SSR back to the Russian SFSR.
Although an antenna may be designed to have a purely resistive feedpoint impedance (such as a dipole 97% of a half wavelength long) this might not be exactly true at the frequency that it is eventually used at.
An antenna's bandwidth specifies the range of frequencies over which its performance does not suffer due to a poor impedance match.
She contributed four songs to its soundtrack, including the title track and "Causing a Commotion".
Rather than just using a thick tube, there are similar techniques used to the same effect such as replacing thin wire elements with cages to simulate a thicker element.
A popular solution uses so-called traps consisting of parallel resonant circuits which are strategically placed in breaks along each antenna element.
Gain is a parameter which measures the degree of directivity of the antenna's radiation pattern.
While shooting the film, Madonna began a relationship with Beatty, which dissolved by the end of 1990.
High-gain antennas have the advantage of longer range and better signal quality, but must be aimed carefully at the other antenna.
According to law, during 1992, it was allowed to use the old name of the RSFSR for official business (forms, seals and stamps).
Rolling Stone called it an "elaborately choreographed, sexually provocative extravaganza" and proclaimed it "the best tour of 1990".
The tour generated strong negative reaction from religious groups for her performance of "Like a Virgin", during which two male dancers caressed her body before she simulated masturbation.
Therefore, the effective area Aeff in terms of the gain G in a given direction is given by:
The radiation of many antennas shows a pattern of maxima or "lobes" at various angles, separated by "nulls", angles where the radiation falls to zero.
He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years.
His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his The Standard Elocutionist (1860), which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868.
In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct deaf-mutes (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning.
As a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father.
According to reciprocity, the efficiency of an antenna used as a receiving antenna is identical to the efficiency as defined above.
His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades.
Something to Remember, a collection of ballads, was released in November 1995.
This is likewise true for a receiving antenna at very high (especially microwave) frequencies, where the point is to receive a signal which is strong compared to the receiver's noise temperature.
Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a "big prize" if they were successful.
For radio waves, one important reflector is the ionosphere which can change the wave's polarization.
Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a telegraph wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend.
Polarization is the sum of the E-plane orientations over time projected onto an imaginary plane perpendicular to the direction of motion of the radio wave.
Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to Susanna E. Hull's private school for the deaf in South Kensington, London.
While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a family, Bell continued as a teacher.
Intermediate matchings will lose some signal strength, but not as much as a complete mismatch.
A circularly polarized antenna can be used to equally well match vertical or horizontal linear polarizations.
She recorded the single "Beautiful Stranger" for the 1999 film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.
In 1870, at age 23, Bell, his brother's widow, Caroline (Margaret Ottaway), and his parents travelled on the SS Nestorian to Canada.
For instance, a "whip antenna" can be made significantly shorter than 1/4 wavelength long, for practical reasons, and then resonated using a so-called loading coil.
The property consisted of an orchard, large farm house, stable, pigsty, hen-house, and a carriage house, which bordered the Grand River.[N 9]
In principle this can always be done with a transformer, however the turns ratio of a transformer is not adjustable.
He also modified a melodeon (a type of pump organ) so that it could transmit its music electrically over a distance.
Antennas based on the dipole (rather than vertical antennas) should include a balun in between the transmission line and antenna element, which may be integrated into any such matching network.
They have linear polarization (except for the helical antenna).
Also, in the particular case of a monopole antenna, the ground (or an artificial ground plane) serves as the return connection for the antenna current thus having an additional effect, particularly on the impedance seen by the feed line.
Several influential people of the time, including Bell, viewed deafness as something that should be eradicated, and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of sign language, thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded.
But if the ground has irregularities not small compared to the wavelength, reflections will not be coherent but shifted by random phases.
Owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language, Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing Deaf culture.
The dielectric constant and conductivity (or simply the complex dielectric constant) is dependent on the soil type and is a function of frequency.
Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches.
The effective area or effective aperture of a receiving antenna expresses the portion of the power of a passing electromagnetic wave which it delivers to its terminals, expressed in terms of an equivalent area.
On the other hand, a thick element presents less reactance at an off-resonant frequency, and consequently a Q as low as 5.
Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound.
If the element has a length-to-diameter ratio of 1000, it will have an inherent resistance of about 63 ohms.
Madonna embarked on the Confessions Tour in May 2006, which had a global audience of 1.2 million and grossed over $193.7 million, becoming the highest-grossing tour to that date for a female artist.
That same morning, Bell's lawyer filed Bell's application with the patent office.
It can, for instance, bring the wave to a focus or alter the wave front in other ways, generally in order to maximize the directivity of the antenna system.
Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray's patent caveat.
The vertical plane radiation patterns are shown in the image at right.
Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device.
As the antenna height is increased, the number of lobes increases as well.
In digital terrestrial television such reflections are less problematic, due to robustness of binary transmissions and error correction.
However, because of the mutual interaction between their electric and magnetic fields due to proximity, the currents in each element are not simply a function of the applied voltage (according to its driving point impedance), but depend on the currents in the other nearby elements.
This is the case, for instance, with the so-called parasitic elements of a Yagi-Uda antenna where the solid rod can be viewed as a dipole antenna shorted across its feedpoint.
it pushed Madonna past Elvis Presley as the artist with the most top-ten hits.
It contained the new songs "Celebration" and "Revolver" along with 34 hits spanning her career.
Controversy erupted when Madonna decided to adopt from Malawi again.
Mercy's grandmother had initially protested the adoption, but later gave in, saying "At first I didn't want her to go but as a family we had to sit down and reach an agreement and we agreed that Mercy should go.
This feature is lacking in the descendants of their nearest algal relatives, the Charophycean green algae.
186,787 dated January 30, 1877) were no longer in effect, although the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the case's importance as a "precedent".
The result for the ancestors of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case, the seed.
The value of the Bell patent was acknowledged throughout the world, and patent applications were made in most major countries, but when Bell had delayed the German patent application, the electrical firm of Siemens & Halske (S&H) managed to set up a rival manufacturer of Bell telephones under their own patent.
Madonna contributed the ballad "Masterpiece" for the film's soundtrack, which won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.
The evolution of seed plants and later angiosperms appears to be the result of two distinct rounds of whole genome duplication events.
Lawsuits threatened against Madonna have also been engaged from the tour.
Despite this declaration, Bell has been proudly claimed as a "native son" by all three countries he resided in: the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
By 1889, a large house, christened The Lodge was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings, including a new laboratory, were begun that the Bells would name Beinn Bhreagh (Gaelic: beautiful mountain) after Bell's ancestral Scottish highlands.[N 21]
The Bells were still in residence at Beinn Bhreagh when the Halifax Explosion occurred on December 6, 1917.
With the film she launched the Art for Freedom initiative, which helped to promote "art and free speech as a means to address persecution and injustice across the globe".
The website for the project has had over 3,000 art related submissions since its inception, with Madonna regularly monitoring and enlisting the help of other artists like David Blaine and Katy Perry as guest curators.
Although many such mutualistic relationships remain too fragile to survive competition and to spread widely, flowering proved to be an unusually effective means of reproduction, spreading (whatever its origin) to become the dominant form of land plant life.
The most primitive flowers probably had a variable number of flower parts, often separate from (but in contact with) each other.
These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the photophone, one for the phonograph, five for aerial vehicles, four for "hydroairplanes" and two for selenium cells.
As flowers evolved, some variations developed parts fused together, with a much more specific number and design, and with either specific sexes per flower or plant or at least "ovary-inferior".
During his Volta Laboratory period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record as a means of reproducing sound.
This included flowering plants possessing seeds enclosed in capsules, distinguished from his Gymnospermae, or flowering plants with achenial or schizo-carpic fruits, the whole fruit or each of its pieces being here regarded as a seed and naked.
Bell is also credited with developing one of the early versions of a metal detector in 1881.
Her pieces explore various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition."
Updates incorporating more recent research were published as APG II in 2003 and as APG III in 2009.
Rolling Stone has named her "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics."
Recent studies, as by the APG, show that the monocots form a monophyletic group (clade) but that the dicots do not (they are paraphyletic).
The rest include a paraphyletic grouping of primitive species known collectively as the basal angiosperms, plus the families Ceratophyllaceae and Chloranthaceae.
This compares to around 12,000 species of moss or 11,000 species of pteridophytes, showing that the flowering plants are much more diverse.
The number of families in APG (1998) was 462.
During his world tour of 1910–11, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in France.
Bell's report to the U.S. Navy permitted him to obtain two 350 horsepower (260 kilowatts) engines in July 1919.
Her versatility was further shown on I'm Breathless, which consists predominantly of the 1940s Broadway showtune-flavoured jazz, swing and big band tracks.
In 1898, Bell experimented with tetrahedral box kites and wings constructed of multiple compound tetrahedral kites covered in maroon silk.[N 23]
She tried to remain contemporary by incorporating samples, drum loops and hip hop into her music.
Madonna returned to pure dance songs with Confessions on a Dance Floor, infusing club beats and retro music with the lyrics about paradoxical metaphors and reference to her earlier works.
Homomorphic flowers may employ a biochemical (physiological) mechanism called self-incompatibility to discriminate between self and non-self pollen grains.
In other species, the male and female parts are morphologically separated, developing on different flowers.
Their final aircraft design, the Silver Dart, embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines.
During the filming of Evita, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further.
By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and California's compulsory sterilization law was used as a model for that of Nazi Germany.
Emmy, where she performed as the guitarist and lead vocalist.
In 1880, Bell received the Volta Prize with a purse of 50,000 francs (approximately US$250,000 in today's dollars) for the invention of the telephone from the Académie française, representing the French government.
Since then Madonna has played guitar on every tour, as well as her studio albums.
He concludes that "some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Madonna is not different than them."
He was one of the founders of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1884, and served as its president from 1891–92.
Honors and tributes flowed to Bell in increasing numbers as his most famous invention became ubiquitous and his personal fame grew.
They would study pictures of her and come to think that she resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses.
It was an evocation of the impact religion had on her career.
On the Who's That Girl World Tour, she dedicated the song "Papa Don't Preach" to Pope John Paul II.
Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend", from the film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953).
In many places, especially in villages, a pub can be the focal point of the community.
This lasted until 1321, when the Kakatiya dynasty was annexed by Malik Kafur, Allaudin Khilji's general.
According to biographer Andrew Morton, "Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately she is deeply hurt."
The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as "Papa Don't Preach", "Like a Prayer", or "Justify My Love" had to do with the music videos created to promote the songs and their impact, rather than the songs themselves.
The nine Telugu- and Urdu-speaking districts of Hyderabad State in the Telangana region were merged with the Telugu-speaking Andhra State to create Andhra Pradesh, with Hyderabad as its capital.
With the final assent of the President of India in June 2014, Telangana state was formed.
The prohibitive duty was gradually reduced and finally abolished in 1742.
Rolling Stone of Spain wrote that "She became the first viral Master of Pop in history, years before the Internet was massively used.
Under the 1830 Act any householder who paid rates could apply, with a one-off payment of two guineas (roughly equal in value to £168 today), to sell beer or cider in his home (usually the front parlour) and even to brew his own on his premises.
The permission did not extend to the sale of spirits and fortified wines, and any beer house discovered selling those items was closed down and the owner heavily fined.
Beer houses were not permitted to open on Sundays.
The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) oversees the civic infrastructure of the city's 18 "circles", which together encompass 150 municipal wards.
Each ward is represented by a corporator, elected by popular vote.
Finally in 1869 the growth had to be checked by magisterial control and new licensing laws were introduced.
There was already regulation on public drinking spaces in the 17th and 18th centuries,[citation needed] and the income earned from licences was beneficial to the crown.
From the mid-19th century on the opening hours of licensed premises in the UK were restricted.
Professor Sut Jhally has referred to Madonna as "an almost sacred feminist icon."
Madonna has received acclaim as a role model for businesswomen in her industry, "achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry", and generating over $1.2 billion in sales within the first decade of her career.
As of 2010[update]–11, the city had 50 government hospitals, 300 private and charity hospitals and 194 nursing homes providing around 12,000 hospital beds, fewer than half the required 25,000.
Private clinics are preferred by many residents because of the distance to, poor quality of care at and long waiting times in government facilities,:60–61 despite the high proportion of the city's residents being covered by government health insurance: 24% according to a National Family Health Survey in 2005.:41
She is also the highest grossing solo touring artist, with over $1.31 billion in concert gross, starting from the Blond Ambition World Tour; she first crossed a billion gross with The MDNA Tour.
There was a special case established under the State Management Scheme where the brewery and licensed premises were bought and run by the state until 1973, most notably in Carlisle.
In England and Wales by 2000 pubs could legally open from 11 am (12 noon on Sundays) through to 11 pm (10:30 pm on Sundays).
This allowed pubs in England and Wales to apply to the local council for the opening hours of their choice.
By the time the law came into effect, 60,326 establishments had applied for longer hours and 1,121 had applied for a licence to sell alcohol 24 hours a day.
The origin of the British lock-in was a reaction to 1915 changes in the licensing laws in England and Wales, which curtailed opening hours to stop factory workers from turning up drunk and harming the war effort.
However, it is important to understand that despite the presence of reception statutes, much of contemporary American common law has diverged significantly from English common law.
North of central Hyderabad lie Hussain Sagar, Tank Bund Road, Rani Gunj and the Secunderabad Railway Station.
In the eastern part of the city lie many defence research centres and Ramoji Film City.
Early on, American courts, even after the Revolution, often did cite contemporary English cases.
The Charminar, Mecca Masjid, Charkaman and Qutb Shahi tombs are other existing structures of this period.
In a handful of areas like insurance, Congress has enacted laws expressly refusing to regulate them as long as the states have laws regulating them (see, e.g., the McCarran-Ferguson Act).
The local police officer might nip in for a quiet pint, the parish priest for his evening whisky, or lovers for a rendezvous.
Until that time beer establishments used to bring the beer out to the table or benches, as remains the practice in (for example) beer gardens and other drinking establishments in Germany.
This is where the act of deciding a case becomes a limited form of lawmaking in itself, in that an appellate court's rulings will thereby bind itself and lower courts in future cases (and therefore also impliedly binds all persons within the court's jurisdiction).
The rule gradually developed, case-by-case, as an extension of the judiciary's public policy of effective judicial administration (that is, in order to efficiently exercise the judicial power).
Although federal courts can create federal common law in the form of case law, such law must be linked one way or another to the interpretation of a particular federal constitutional provision, statute, or regulation (which in turn was enacted as part of the Constitution or after).
Those involved in the informal economy constitute a major portion of urban poor.:71
Most such breweries, such as the regional brewery Shepherd Neame in Kent and Young's and Fuller's in London, control hundreds of pubs in a particular region of the UK, while a few, such as Greene King, are spread nationally.
The landlord of a tied pub may be an employee of the brewery—in which case he/she would be a manager of a managed house, or a self-employed tenant who has entered into a lease agreement with a brewery, a condition of which is the legal obligation (trade tie) only to purchase that brewery's beer.
Normally, state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state constitutions and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by way of a petition for writ of certiorari.
The reign of the Nizams saw many literary reforms and the introduction of Urdu as a language of court, administration and education.
Due to the perennial inability of legislatures in the U.S. to enact statutes that would actually force law enforcement officers to respect the constitutional rights of criminal suspects and convicts, the federal judiciary gradually developed the exclusionary rule as a method to enforce such rights.
Hyderabad has continued with these traditions in its annual Hyderabad Literary Festival, held since 2010, showcasing the city's literary and cultural creativity.
South Indian music and dances such as the Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam styles are popular in the Deccan region.
As a result of their culture policies, North Indian music and dance gained popularity during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams, and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with tawaif (courtesans).
In the past, many rural pubs provided opportunities for country folk to meet and exchange (often local) news, while others—especially those away from village centres—existed for the general purpose, before the advent of motor transport, of serving travellers as coaching inns.
Furthermore, all three states continue to maintain most of their civil procedure laws in the form of codified statutes enacted by the state legislature, as opposed to court rules promulgated by the state supreme court, on the ground that the latter are undemocratic.
The state government organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music.
U.S. courts pioneered the concept of the opt-out class action, by which the burden falls on class members to notify the court that they do not wish to be bound by the judgment, as opposed to opt-in class actions, where class members must join into the class.
Generally, contract law in transactions involving the sale of goods has become highly standardized nationwide as a result of the widespread adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code.
However, there is still significant diversity in the interpretation of other kinds of contracts, depending upon the extent to which a given state has codified its common law of contracts or adopted portions of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.
Television broadcasting in Hyderabad began in 1974 with the launch of Doordarshan, the Government of India's public service broadcaster, which transmits two free-to-air terrestrial television channels and one satellite channel.
In 2011, the military junta was officially dissolved following a 2010 general election, and a nominally civilian government was installed.
Pubs hold special events, from tournaments of the aforementioned games to karaoke nights to pub quizzes.
Some play pop music and hip-hop (dance bar), or show football and rugby union on big screen televisions (sports bar).
Some pubs in the UK also have football teams composed of regular customers.
In English, the country is popularly known as either "Burma" or "Myanmar" i/ˈmjɑːnˌmɑːr/. Both these names are derived from the name of the majority Burmese Bamar ethnic group.
Bowling is found in association with pubs in some parts of the country and the local team will play matches against teams invited from elsewhere on the pub's bowling green.

The first non-indigenous group to set foot in the area was the party of explorer Gaspar de Portolà, who camped near the present day intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues on August 3, 1769.
The two ethnic minorities were often viewed differently by White Americans who were often well-disposed towards the Japanese but condescending towards the Chinese.
The Fitzroy Tavern is a pub situated at 16 Charlotte Street in the Fitzrovia district, to which it gives its name.
It became famous (or according to others, infamous) during a period spanning the 1920s to the mid-1950s as a meeting place for many of London's artists, intellectuals and bohemians such as Dylan Thomas, Augustus John, and George Orwell.
Beginning in late 1944, allied troops launched a series of offensives that led to the end of Japanese rule in July 1945.

In May 2008, Cyclone Nargis caused extensive damage in the densely populated, rice-farming delta of the Irrawaddy Division.
Although "British" pubs found outside of Britain and its former colonies are often themed bars owing little to the original British pub, a number of "true" pubs may be found around the world.
Humanitarian aid was requested but concerns about foreign military or intelligence presence in the country delayed the entry of United States military planes delivering medicine, food, and other supplies.
Overcast skies are common during June mornings, but usually the strong sun burns the fog off by noon.
Nonetheless, it will sometimes stay cloudy and cool all day during June, even as other parts of the Los Angeles area enjoy sunny skies and warmer temperatures.
In the 1800s the term used was "public house" as in England but "pub culture" did not spread to Canada.
Most universities in Canada have campus pubs which are central to student life, as it would be bad form just to serve alcohol to students without providing some type of basic food.
The city first proposed its Sustainable City Plan in 1992 and in 1994, was one of the first cities in the nation to formally adopt a comprehensive sustainability plan, setting waste reduction and water conservation policies for both public and private sector through its Office of Sustainability and the Environment.
The gastropub concept has caught on, as traditional British influences are to be found in many Canadian dishes.
Such an assertion assumes that reforms only occurred when the military was able to safeguard its own interests through the transition—here, "transition" does not refer to a transition to a liberal democracy, but transition to a quasi-military rule.
22,716 households (48.4%) were made up of individuals and 5,551 (11.8%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.
In Brookline, Massachusetts, The World became the first commercial ISP in the US.
There were 17,929 families (38.2% of all households); the average family size was 2.79.
A possible solution to net neutrality concerns may be municipal broadband, according to Professor Susan Crawford, a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School.
On 16 January 2015, Republicans presented legislation, in the form of a U.S. Congress H.R. discussion draft bill, that makes concessions to net neutrality but prohibits the FCC from accomplishing the goal or enacting any further regulation affecting Internet service providers.
On 31 January 2015, AP News reported that the FCC will present the notion of applying ("with some caveats")
Typical jungle animals, particularly tigers and leopards, occur sparsely in Myanmar.
In upper Myanmar, there are rhinoceros, wild buffalo, wild boars, deer, antelope, and elephants, which are also tamed or bred in captivity for use as work animals, particularly in the lumber industry.

Santa Monica has received the Bicycle Friendly Community Award (Bronze in 2009, Silver in 2013) by the League of American Bicyclists.
The elections of 2010 resulted in a victory for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party.
Santa Monica is thought to be one of the leaders for bicycle infrastructure and programming in Los Angeles County.[citation needed]
After traversing Los Angeles County, I-10 crosses seven more states, terminating at Jacksonville, Florida.
Just east of Santa Monica is Interstate 405, the "San Diego Freeway", a major north-south route in Los Angeles County and Orange County, California.
In the simplest case, a single connection is established to an upstream ISP and is used to transmit data to or from areas of the Internet beyond the home network; this mode of interconnection is often cascaded multiple times until reaching a tier 1 carrier.
ISPs may engage in peering, where multiple ISPs interconnect at peering points or Internet exchange points (IXs), allowing routing of data between each network, without charging one another for the data transmitted—data that would otherwise have passed through a third upstream ISP, incurring charges from the upstream ISP.
Network hardware, software and specifications, as well as the expertise of network management personnel are important in ensuring that data follows the most efficient route, and upstream connections work reliably.
The military is very influential in Myanmar, with all top cabinet and ministry posts usually held by military officials.
Modern ISPs integrate a wide array of surveillance and packet sniffing equipment into their networks, which then feeds the data to law-enforcement/intelligence networks (such as DCSNet in the United States, or SORM in Russia) allowing monitoring of Internet traffic in real time.
There is consensus that the military regime in Myanmar is one of the world's most repressive and abusive regimes.
In November 2012, Samantha Power, Barack Obama's Special Assistant to the President on Human Rights, wrote on the White House blog in advance of the president's visit that "Serious human rights abuses against civilians in several regions continue, including against women and children."
International human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have repeatedly documented and condemned widespread human rights violations in Myanmar.
Comics has had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.
Though the term derives from the humorous (or comic) work that predominated in early American newspaper comic strips, it has become standard also for non-humorous works.
The board first approved "Eliot Seminary," but William Eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary, which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith.
The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri.
In 2007 the German professor Bassam Tibi suggested that the Rohingya conflict may be driven by an Islamist political agenda to impose religious laws, while non-religious causes have also been raised, such as a lingering resentment over the violence that occurred during the Japanese occupation of Burma in World War II
In 1856, the University amended its name to "Washington University."
Shorter, black-and-white daily strips began to appear early in the 20th century, and became established in newspapers after the success in 1907 of Bud Fisher's Mutt and Jeff.
Humour strips predominated at first, and in the 1920s and 1930s strips with continuing stories in genres such as adventure and drama also became popular.
Washington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street.

Database designers and database administrators interact with the DBMS through dedicated interfaces to build and maintain the applications' databases, and thus need some more knowledge and understanding about how DBMSs operate and the DBMSs' external interfaces and tuning parameters.
The relational model, first proposed in 1970 by Edgar F. Codd, departed from this tradition by insisting that applications should search for data by content, rather than by following links.
For instance, distend has unaspirated [t] since it is not analyzed as two morphemes, but distaste has an aspirated middle [tʰ] because it is analyzed as dis- + taste and the word taste has an aspirated initial t.
In Danish and most southern varieties of German, the "lenis" consonants transcribed for historical reasons as ⟨b
Cotton is used to make a number of textile products.

It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans.
corresponds to Eastern Armenian aspirated /tʰ/ and voiced /d/, and Western voiced /d/ corresponds to Eastern voiceless /t/.
The relational model also allowed the content of the database to evolve without constant rewriting of links and pointers.
For instance, a common use of a database system is to track information about users, their name, login information, various addresses and phone numbers.
Also, it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones.

This allows for relations between data to be relations to objects and their attributes and not to individual fields.
XML database management systems include commercial software MarkLogic and Oracle Berkeley DB XML, and a free use software Clusterpoint Distributed XML/JSON Database.
Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organisation, like "can a customer also be a supplier?", or "if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?", or "if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?".
That is why H+ is often called a proton.
Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often utilizing the operating systems' file systems as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration setting are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators.
The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits.

The information may comprise specific database objects (e.g., record types, specific records, data structures), certain computations over certain objects (e.g., query types, or specific queries), or utilizing specific access paths to the former (e.g., using specific indexes or other data structures to access information).
If the DBMS provides a way to interactively enter and update the database, as well as interrogate it, this capability allows for managing personal databases.

Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819.
Typically a DBMS vendor provides tools to help importing databases from other popular DBMSs.
To achieve this a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures) is kept within dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively).
Hydrogen-lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war.
Data compression can be viewed as a special case of data differencing: Data differencing consists of producing a difference given a source and a target, with patching producing a target given a source and a difference, while data compression consists of producing a compressed file given a target, and decompression consists of producing a target given only a compressed file.
Therefore, H2 was used in the Hindenburg airship, which was destroyed in a midair fire over New Jersey on 6 May 1937.
Audio data compression, not to be confused with dynamic range compression, has the potential to reduce the transmission bandwidth and storage requirements of audio data.
Many of these algorithms use convolution with the filter [-1 1] to slightly whiten or flatten the spectrum, thereby allowing traditional lossless compression to work more efficiently.
According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass.

Some codecs will analyze a longer segment of the data to optimize efficiency, and then code it in a manner that requires a larger segment of data at one time to decode.
However, hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's atmosphere (1 ppm by volume) because of its light weight, which enables it to escape from Earth's gravity more easily than heavier gases.
However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface, mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water.

Cee Lo Green showed up in the format in 2011.
The "soft" AC format has reinvented in the late 2000s/early 2010s as a result of its declining relevance, adopting a more upmarket, middle-of-the-road approach, with a selection of "oldies" (usually from the 1960s/70s onwards), primarily rock, jazz, R&B and pop music.
These and other communitarians (such as Alasdair MacIntyre and Daniel A. Bell) argue that, contra liberalism, communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus.
Soft AC, which has never minded keeping songs in high rotation literally for years in some cases, does not appear necessarily to be facing similar pressures to expand its format.
The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.
An alloy is distinct from an impure metal, such as wrought iron, in that, with an alloy, the added impurities are usually desirable and will typically have some useful benefit.
In practice, however, they were usually followed by the magistrates.
If the metals remain soluble when solid, the alloy forms a solid solution, becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals, called a phase.
However, in other alloys, the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs.
Some soft AC and urban AC stations like to play smooth jazz on the weekends.
Alloy steels can be made by adding other elements, such as molybdenum, vanadium or nickel, resulting in alloys such as high-speed steel or tool steel.

At a certain temperature, (usually between 1,500 °F (820 °C) and 1,600 °F (870 °C), depending on carbon content), the base metal of steel undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms in its crystal matrix, called allotropy.
Many publications credit DST's proposal to the prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett, who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride, when he observed with dismay how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer's day.
His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months, a proposal he published two years later.
A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not become law, and several other bills failed in the following years.
When rapidly cooled, a diffusionless (martensite) transformation occurs, in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution.

The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor never stops (like a compass needle does), but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied.
In Greek history, the Achaemenid Empire is considered as the antagonist of the Greek city states, for the emancipation of slaves including the Jewish exiles in Babylon, building infrastructures such as road and postal systems, and the use of an official language, the Imperial Aramaic, throughout its territories.

If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made in the form of a cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets.
Optimized for rapid acceleration, these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core.
But because there is no metal mass in the rotor to act as a heat sink, even small coreless motors must often be cooled by forced air.

This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load.
Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque, such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill.
If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable.

An opposite example is the case of Chinese, whose variations such as Mandarin and Cantonese are often called dialects and not languages, despite their mutual unintelligibility.
The endeavors also resulted in the formation of the Tehran World Festival in 1973.
A group speaking a separate "language" is often seen as having a greater claim to being a separate "people", and thus to be more deserving of its own independent state, while a group speaking a "dialect" tends to be seen not as "a people" in its own right, but as a sub-group, part of a bigger people, which must content itself with regional autonomy.[citation needed]
The distinction between language and dialect is thus inevitably made at least as much on a political basis as on a linguistic one, and can lead to great political controversy, or even armed conflict.

Whitehead was able to exert his newfound influence to successfully lobby for a new history of science department, help establish a Bachelor of Science degree (previously only Bachelor of Arts degrees had been offered), and make the school more accessible to less wealthy students.
In addition to numerous articles on mathematics, Whitehead wrote three major books on the subject: A Treatise on Universal Algebra (1898), Principia Mathematica (co-written with Bertrand Russell and published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913), and An Introduction to Mathematics (1911).
The vocal practices changed a great deal over the classical period, from the single line monophonic Gregorian chant done by monks in the Medieval period to the complex, polyphonic choral works of the Renaissance and subsequent periods, which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time.
Principia Mathematica in particular is regarded as one of the most important works in mathematical logic of the 20th century.

However, Gödel could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book.
Woodwind instruments included the double reed shawm, the reed pipe, the bagpipe, the transverse flute and the recorder.
Rather than teach small parts of a large number of subjects, Whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge, discovering their application in actual life.
Whitehead did not begin his career as a philosopher.
Ironically, in later life Whitehead would become one of the 20th century's foremost metaphysicians.
In the notes of one his students for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: "Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics.
In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned.
Perhaps foremost among what Whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions was the Cartesian idea that reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally independently of one another, which he rejected in favor of an event-based or "process" ontology in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another.
The Classical era stringed instruments were the four instruments which form the string section of the orchestra: the violin, viola, cello and contrabass.
Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact.
While the harpsichord was still used in basso continuo accompaniment in the 1750s and 1760s, it fell out of use in the end of the century.
Whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as "philosophy of organism", but it would become known more widely as "process philosophy."
The exceptions to this are his Symphony No. 4, Violin Concerto, and Piano Concerto No. 4, which each specify a single flute.
His philosophical work is generally considered to be among the most difficult to understand in all of the western canon.
Wieman's lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years, and for at least thirty years afterward Chicago's Divinity School was closely associated with Whitehead's thought.
In the Romantic era, the modern piano, with a more powerful, sustained tone and a wider range took over from the more delicate-sounding fortepiano.
In the orchestra, the existing Classical instruments and sections were retained (string section, woodwinds, brass and percussion), but these sections were typically expanded to make a fuller, bigger sound.
For example, while a Baroque orchestra may have had two double bass players, a Romantic orchestra could have as many as ten. "
What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events.
After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience.
While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example Maurice Ravel's orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and Sergei Rachmaninoff's Symphonic Dances, the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's Boléro, Sergei Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2 and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble.
These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a "society" of events.
In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g. "Mark's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older, but he is still the same person").
Many instruments today associated with popular music filled important roles in early classical music, such as bagpipes, vihuelas, hurdy-gurdies, and some woodwind instruments.
After all, each moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago.
degree (which includes individual lessons from professors).
But in Whitehead's view, relations take a primary role, perhaps even more important than the relata themselves.
Insoluble fiber, found in whole wheat flour, nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates peristalsis – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digesta along the digestive tract.
A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several fatty acids (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a glycerol.
There are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat.
" It is, in other words, the sense of causal relations between entities, a feeling of being influenced and affected by the surrounding environment, unmediated by the senses.
Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as butter or lard), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as olive oil or flaxseed oil).
The dates are generalizations, since the periods and eras overlap and the categories are somewhat arbitrary, to the point that some authorities reverse terminologies and refer to a common practice "era" comprising baroque, classical, and romantic "periods".
This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it.
Without such a goal, he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible.
His system required that an order exist among possibilities, an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities.
This led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of God, the consequent nature.
For all animals, some amino acids are essential (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are non-essential (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds).
God's consequent nature, on the other hand, is anything but unchanging –
Later in the period, early versions of keyboard instruments like the clavichord and harpsichord began to appear.
Whitehead thus sees God and the world as fulfilling one another.
The Classical era followed, ending roughly around 1820.
God gives creatures permanence, while the creatures give God actuality and change.
Music became more complex in comparison with the songs of earlier periods.
His most famous remark on religion is that "religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary, you are never religious."
He took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence, it is not necessarily good – an idea which he called a "dangerous delusion" (e.g., a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion's adherents).
Whitehead also described religion more technically as "an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone."
The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet.
The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing.
Moreover, thousands of different phytochemicals have recently been discovered in food (particularly in fresh vegetables), which may have desirable properties including antioxidant activity (see below); however, experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive.
The piano, which achieved its modern construction in this era (in part due to industrial advances in metallurgy) became widely popular with the middle class, whose demands for the instrument spurred a large number of piano builders.
The size of the orchestra (typically around 40 in the Classical era) grew to be over 100.
When interacting with a free radical, some antioxidants produce a different free radical compound that is less dangerous or more dangerous than the previous compound.
In humans, the four dominant phyla are Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria.
He articulated a view that might perhaps be regarded as dual to Einstein's general relativity, see Whitehead's theory of gravitation.
" Many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose, while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize.
Yutaka Tanaka, who suggests that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings, proposes that Einstein's work does not actually refute Whitehead's formulation.
All of these chemical compounds and elements occur in various forms and combinations (e.g. hormones, vitamins, phospholipids, hydroxyapatite).
Though some molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream unchanged, digestive processes release them from the matrix of foods.

Others have rejected that the doctrine of Immaculate Conception exists in Islam, the Quranic account does not confirm the Immaculate Conception exclusively for Mary as in Islam every human child is born pure and immaculate, her sinless birth is thus independent of the Christian docrtrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in Islam.
According to geologist Stefan Schmid, because the Western Alps underwent a metamorphic event in the Cenozoic Era while the Austroalpine peaks underwent an event in the Cretaceous Period, the two areas show distinct differences in nappe formations.

A capacitor is assumed to be self-contained and isolated, with no net electric charge and no influence from any external electric field.
Rather, one electron accumulates on the negative plate for each one that leaves the positive plate, resulting in an electron depletion and consequent positive charge on one electrode that is equal and opposite to the accumulated negative charge on the other.
This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations.
This is the integral form of the capacitor equation:
Assuming that the length and width of the plates are much greater than their separation d, the electric field near the centre of the device will be uniform with the magnitude E = ρ/ε.
The maximum energy is a function of dielectric volume, permittivity, and dielectric strength.
Some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid (synonymous mutations).
Some of these, such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear, or can be assumed to be linear, and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of the capacitor.
The usual methods of network analysis can then be applied.

The smallest genomes occur in viruses (which can have as few as 2 protein-coding genes), and viroids (which act as a single non-coding RNA gene).
In DC circuits and pulsed circuits, current and voltage reversal are affected by the damping of the system.
The current and voltage will tend to oscillate and may reverse direction several times, with each peak being lower than the previous, until the system reaches an equilibrium.
On discharging a capacitor and disconnecting it, after a short time it may develop a voltage due to hysteresis in the dielectric.
This effect can be objectionable in applications such as precision sample and hold circuits or timing circuits.

An army uprising in May 1998 led to the Guinea-Bissau Civil War and the president's ousting in June 1999.
Since the 1980s, surface mount packages for capacitors have been widely used.
Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations.
Some aircraft serve specialized transportation roles such as executive/embassy support (C-12), Antarctic Support (LC-130H), and USSOCOM support (C-27J, C-145A, and C-146A).
The capacitors act as a local reserve for the DC power source, and bypass AC currents from the power supply.
Former vice chief of staff, General Mamadu Ture Kuruma, assumed control of the country in the transitional period and started negotiations with opposition parties.
In the past, the government had been highly centralized.
They are popularly elected from multi-member constituencies to serve a four-year term.
Vieira returned to power in 2005 six years after being ousted from office during a civil war.
Previously, he held power for 19 years after taking power in 1980 in a bloodless coup.
In that action, he toppled the government of Luís Cabral.
He was killed on 2 March 2009, possibly by soldiers in retaliation for the assassination of General Batista Tagme Na Waie, the head of the joint chiefs of staff, killed in an explosion.
Typically they can have up-to four times as much starting torque than a split-phase motor and are used on applications such as compressors, pressure washers and any small device requiring high starting torques.
Major General Charles J. Dunlap, Jr. adds that the U.S. Air Force's culture also includes an egalitarianism bred from officers perceiving themselves as their service's principal "warriors" working with small groups of enlisted airmen either as the service crew or the onboard crew of their aircraft.
Guinea-Bissau is bordered by Senegal to the north and Guinea to the south and east, with the Atlantic Ocean to its west.
In spite of an urgent need for UAVs or drones to provide round the clock coverage for American troops during the Iraq War, the USAF did not establish a new career field for piloting them until the last year of that war and in 2014 changed its RPA training syllabus again, in the face of large aircraft losses in training, and in response to a GAO report critical of handling of drone programs.
Guinea-Bissau's GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the world, and its Human Development Index is one of the lowest on earth.
Guinea-Bissau has started to show some economic advances after a pact of stability was signed by the main political parties of the country, leading to an IMF-backed structural reform program.
The civil war that took place in 1998 and 1999, and a military coup in September 2003 again disrupted economic activity, leaving a substantial part of the economic and social infrastructure in ruins and intensifying the already widespread poverty.
As noted by Kroemer Braunstein".. had set up a simple optical communications link: Music emerging from a record player was used via suitable electronics to modulate the forward current of a GaAs diode.
This surplus allowed a community to support individuals who did things other than work towards bare survival.
We had a great deal of fun playing with this setup."
44% speak Kriol, a Portuguese-based creole language, which is effectively a national language of communication among groups.
Nevertheless, it applies the following components to the treatment of disease: examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, which display strong parallels to the basic empirical method of science and according to G. E. R. Lloyd played a significant role in the development of this methodology.
Most Portuguese and Mestiços speak one of the African languages and Kriol as second languages.
The Ebers papyrus (c. 1550 BC) also contains evidence of traditional empiricism.
From their beginnings in Sumer (now Iraq) around 3500 BC, the Mesopotamian people began to attempt to record some observations of the world with numerical data.
Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian proto-scientists are still widely used in Western calendars such as the solar year and the lunar month.
Approximately 10% of the country's population belong to the Christian community, and 40% continue to hold Indigenous beliefs.
The Monsanto Company was the first organization to mass-produce visible LEDs, using gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) in 1968 to produce red LEDs suitable for indicators.
Later, other colors became widely available and appeared in appliances and equipment.
According to a 2013 UNICEF report, 50% of women in Guinea Bissau had undergone female genital mutilation.
phosphor coating on the emitter absorbs some of the blue emission and produces yellow light through fluorescence.

One of the best examples would be Shen Kuo (1031–1095), a polymath scientist and statesman who was the first to describe the magnetic-needle compass used for navigation, discovered the concept of true north, improved the design of the astronomical gnomon, armillary sphere, sight tube, and clepsydra, and described the use of drydocks to repair boats.
White light can be formed by mixing differently colored lights; the most common method is to use red, green, and blue (RGB).
It begins at Avenue C and ends at West Street.
For example, the dichromatic white LEDs have the best luminous efficacy (120 lm/W), but the lowest color rendering capability.
It forms the northern borders of both Union Square (between Broadway and Park Avenue South) and Stuyvesant Square.
There used to be an 18th Street station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line at the crossing with Park Avenue South.
Thus, many new package designs aimed at solving this problem have been proposed and their results are now being reproduced by researchers and scientists.
Travel on the last block of the 20th, 21st and 22nd Streets, between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues, is in the opposite direction than it is on the rest of the respective street.
If several phosphor layers of distinct colors are applied, the emitted spectrum is broadened, effectively raising the color rendering index (CRI) value of a given LED.
For example, the luminous efficacy of a typical YAG yellow phosphor based white LED ranges from 3 to 5 times the luminous efficacy of the original blue LED because of the human eye's greater sensitivity to yellow than to blue (as modeled in the luminosity function).
On 23rd Street there are five local subway stations:
24th Street starts at First Avenue and it ends at Madison Avenue, because of Madison Square Park.
An intellectual revitalization of Europe started with the birth of medieval universities in the 12th century.
The contact with the Islamic world in Spain and Sicily, and during the Reconquista and the Crusades, allowed Europeans access to scientific Greek and Arabic texts, including the works of Aristotle, Ptolemy, Jābir ibn Hayyān, al-Khwarizmi, Alhazen, Avicenna, and Averroes.
European scholars had access to the translation programs of Raymond of Toledo, who sponsored the 12th century Toledo School of Translators from Arabic to Latin.
The Catholic church of St. Francis of Assisi is situated at 135–139 West 31st Street.

The Oxford Calculators began to mathematically analyze the kinematics of motion, making this analysis without considering the causes of motion.
These developments paved the way for the Scientific Revolution, which may also be understood as a resumption of the process of scientific inquiry, halted at the start of the Black Death.
The renewal of learning in Europe, that began with 12th century Scholasticism, came to an end about the time of the Black Death, and the initial period of the subsequent Italian Renaissance is sometimes seen as a lull in scientific activity.
The Northern Renaissance, on the other hand, showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristoteleian natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).
The low-power dissipation of these LEDs affords them more flexibility than the original AC LED design.
Seminary row runs in Morningside Heights, the district surrounding Columbia University, and crosses portions of Broadway and Claremont Avenue.
Seven-segment displays handle all numbers and a limited set of letters.
The Romantic Movement of the early 19th century reshaped science by opening up new pursuits unexpected in the classical approaches of the Enlightenment.
-73.9575 La Salle Street is a street in West Harlem that runs just two blocks between Amsterdam Avenue and Claremont Avenue.

Light-emitting diodes (as well as semiconductor lasers) are used to send data over many types of fiber optic cable, from digital audio over TOSLINK cables to the very high bandwidth fiber links that form the Internet backbone.
A building’s carbon footprint from lighting can therefore be reduced by 85% by exchanging all incandescent bulbs for new LEDs if a building previously used only incandescent bulbs.
Theophrastus' work on rocks, Peri lithōn, remained authoritative for millennia: its interpretation of fossils was not overturned until after the Scientific Revolution.
Machine vision systems often require bright and homogeneous illumination, so features of interest are easier to process.
Barcode scanners are the most common example of machine vision, and many low cost products use red LEDs instead of lasers.
Many sensor systems rely on light as the signal source.
Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior.
Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations.
The forward voltage drop (e.g. about 1.7 V for a normal red LED) can be used instead of a Zener diode in low-voltage regulators.
Although LED forward voltage is far more current-dependent than a Zener diode, Zener diodes with breakdown voltages below 3 V are not widely available.
By 1953, James D. Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins clarified the basic structure of DNA, the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms.
In the late 20th century, the possibilities of genetic engineering became practical for the first time, and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human genome (the Human Genome Project).
Later writers have expanded this test, attempting to define power in terms of overall military, economic, and political capacity.
These expanded criteria can be divided into three heads: power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status.
The brain is small and simple in some species, such as nematode worms; in other species, including vertebrates, it is the most complex organ in the body.
Brains are most simply compared in terms of their size.
The relationship between brain size, body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate species.
Additional specialties such as sociolinguistics, cognitive linguistics, and computational linguistics have emerged from collaboration between linguistics and other disciplines.
In general, smaller animals tend to have larger brains, measured as a fraction of body size.
I the German Empire was defeated, the Austria-Hungarian empire was divided into new, less powerful states and the Russian Empire fell to a revolution.
This replaced the labor theory of value by a system of supply and demand.
In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.
But by the mid-1950s the British Empire lost its superpower status, leaving the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's superpowers.[nb 2] The term middle power has emerged for those nations which exercise a degree of global influence, but are insufficient to be decisive on international affairs.
These distortions can make it difficult to match brain components from one species with those of another species.
The final decades of the 20th century have seen the rise of a new interdisciplinary approach to studying human psychology, known collectively as cognitive science.
Baron argues several reasons why this is the case, citing the unprecedented rise of the United States and its predominant position as the key reason.
Size, however, is not the only difference: there are also substantial differences in shape.
In reaction, conflict theory was developed, which was based in part on the philosophies of Karl Marx.
The visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas, with a complex web of interconnections.
It has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy more than half of the total surface of the primate neocortex.
Subfields include computability, computational complexity, database design, computer networking, artificial intelligence, and the design of computer hardware.
As an academic field, history of science began with the publication of William Whewell's History of the Inductive Sciences (first published in 1837).
Between 1500 and 1953, there were 64 wars in which at least one great power was opposed to another, and they averaged little more than five years in length.
In humans and many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain contains substantially more neurons than the adult brain.
It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science.
Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the lifespan.
Further studies, e.g. Jerome Ravetz 1971 Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems referred to the role of the scientific community, as a social construct, in accepting or rejecting (objective) scientific knowledge.
The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight.
Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly the aforementioned flightless penguins, and also members of the duck family, have also evolved for swimming.
Some birds, especially corvids and parrots, are among the most intelligent animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture.
Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.
Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilized, though unfertilized eggs do not produce offspring.
In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task.
The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue.
The first Digimon anime introduced the Digimon life cycle:
The Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx is well known as one of the first transitional fossils to be found, and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century.
It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds, though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor.
The avialan species from this time period include Anchiornis huxleyi, Xiaotingia zhengi, and Aurornis xui.
The well-known early avialan, Archaeopteryx, dates from slightly later Jurassic rocks (about 155 million years old) from Germany.
Furthermore, even single neurons appear to be complex and capable of performing computations.
In Japan, Digital Monster X-Evolution, the eighth TV movie, was released on January 3, 2005, and on December 23, 2005 at Jump Festa 2006, the fifth series, Digimon Savers was announced for Japan to begin airing after a three-year hiatus of the show.
Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain.
The Aves are agreed to have evolved in the Cretaceous, and the split between the Galloanseri from other Neognathes occurred before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, but there are different opinions about whether the radiation of the remaining Neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs.
The Digimon usually reached higher forms when their human partners are placed in dangerous situations, such as fighting the evil forces of Devimon, Etemon and Myotismon in their Champion forms.
More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.
The most recent effort is drawn above and is based on whole genome sequencing of 48 representative species.
This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements.
Neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours, circadian rhythms: these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of "clock genes".
The plot revolves around three Tamers, Takato Matsuki, Rika Nonaka, and Henry Wong.
Guilmon takes form from Takato's sketchings of a new Digimon.
This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca.
Takuya Kanbara, Koji Minamoto, Junpei Shibayama, Zoe Orimoto, Tommy Himi, and Koichi Kimura go to a subway station and take a train to the Digital World.
After the defeat of Cherubimon, the Digidestined find they must face an even greater challenge as they try to stop the Royal Knights—Dynasmon and Crusadermon—from destroying the Digital World and using the collected data to revive the original ruler of the Digital World: the tyrannical Lucemon.
These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies.
Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus.
The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.
Most organisms studied to date utilize a reward–punishment mechanism: for instance, worms and insects can alter their behavior to seek food sources or to avoid dangers.
Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation.
The English version was dubbed by Studiopolis and it premiered on the Jetix block on Toon Disney on October 1, 2007.
Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain.
Theorists dating back to Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons.
This included giving the Japanese characters full Americanized names and American surnames as well as applying far more Americanization (Marcus Damon as opposed to the Japanese Daimon Masaru), cultural streamlining and more edits to their version similar to the changes 4Kids often made (such as removal of Japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining).
Three and a quarter years after the end of the fifth series, a new sixth series was confirmed by Bandai for the Digimon anime, its official name of the series revealed in the June issue of Shueisha's V Jump magazine being Digimon Xros Wars.
Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste.
Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure.
Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen.
The nervous system is large relative to the bird's size.
The most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building.
Birds are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones.
Birds have specialized light-sensing cells deep in their brains that respond to light without input from eyes or other sensory neurons.
The series announced the return of the protagonists from the original Digimon Adventure series, most of them now as high school students.
The most common subjects are mice, because of the availability of technical tools.
The Roman physician Galen also argued for the importance of the brain, and theorized in some depth about how it might work.
These original stories only roughly followed the continuity of Adventure 02.
They facilitate flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signaling.
In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.
Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae.
On Earth, 99% of glacial ice is contained within vast ice sheets in the polar regions, but glaciers may be found in mountain ranges on every continent except Australia, and on a few high-latitude oceanic islands.
Many glaciers from temperate, alpine and seasonal polar climates store water as ice during the colder seasons and release it later in the form of meltwater as warmer summer temperatures cause the glacier to melt, creating a water source that is especially important for plants, animals and human uses when other sources may be scant.
Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes.
About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds.
In the United States the now aging Julia Ward Howe, author of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, leaped into the war of words and joined the Red Cross.
Other birds are scavengers; some of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.
In the north is "Scythia this side of the Himalayas" and "Scythia beyond the Himalayas."
These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere.
Their goals were to obtain trading concessions by treaty.
Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form.
The Ottoman Empire was created from the lands of the former eastern Roman Empire on the occasion of the latter's violent demise.
Moving glacier ice can sometimes separate from stagnant ice above, forming a bergschrund.
Serbia was created by the Serbian Revolution, 1815–1833.
There may be no motion in stagnant areas; for example, in parts of Alaska, trees can establish themselves on surface sediment deposits.
Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock.
A few glaciers have periods of very rapid advancement called surges.
During these surges, the glacier may reach velocities far greater than normal speed.
The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where "dances" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.
While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks.
In 1855 a reprint of a letter earlier sent to The Times appeared in Littel's Living Age.
Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.
"Near East" remained popular in diplomatic, trade and journalistic circles, but a variation soon developed among the scholars and the men of the cloth and their associates: "the Nearer East," reverting to the classical and then more scholarly distinction of "nearer" and "farther.
For example, The London Review of 1861 (Telford and Barber, unsigned) in reviewing several works by Rawlinson, Layard and others, defined themselves as making:
Hogarth gives no evidence of being familiar with the contemporaneous initial concept of the Middle East.
In 1894, Sir Henry Norman, 1st Baronet, a journalist, travelled to the Far East, afterwards writing a book called The Peoples and Politics of the Far East, which came out in 1895.
Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids.
As the book was a big success, he was off to the Balkan states with his wife in 1896 to develop detail for a sequel, The People and Politics of the Near East, which Scribners planned to publish in 1897.
Furthermore, "Greece shook off the turbaned destroyer of her people" and so on.
Roche moutonnée are elongated, rounded, and asymmetrical bedrock knobs that can be produced by glacier erosion.
Large masses, such as ice sheets or glaciers, can depress the crust of the Earth into the mantle.
Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds.
These were fighting words to be coming from a country that once insisted Europe needed Turkey and was willing to spill blood over it.
Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).
An uncountable number of places appear to have had their middle easts from gardens to regions, including the United States.
The total super-region consisted of "India, Afghanistan, Persia, Arabistan, Asia Minor, and last, but not least, Egypt."
Comcast was also named a "Top 2014 Workplace" by the Washington Post in their annual feature.
This view reveals a somewhat less than altruistic Christian intent of the British Empire; however, it was paradoxical from the beginning, as Simpson and most other writers pointed out.
The Ottomans were portrayed as the slavers, but even as the American and British fleets were striking at the Barbary pirates on behalf of freedom, their countries were promulgating a vigorous African slave trade of their own.
Avivores are animals that are specialized at preying on birds.
Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfill ecological roles typically played by larger animals.

As part of this acquisition, Comcast also acquired the National Digital Television Center in Centennial, Colorado as a wholly owned subsidiary, which is today known as the Comcast Media Center.
Birds have themselves been deified, as in the case of the common peacock, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the Dravidians of India.
Birds have featured in culture and art since prehistoric times, when they were represented in early cave paintings.
Comcast denied the rumors at first, while NBC would not comment on them.
On November 1, 2009, The New York Times reported Comcast had moved closer to a deal to purchase NBCUniversal and that a formal announcement could be made sometime the following week.

When, in response to the violently anti-foreign Yihetuan ("Boxers"), foreign powers invaded China, the Empress Dowager declared war on them, leading to defeat and the flight of the Imperial Court to Xi'an.
Although the name of the CIA reflects the original advised intent of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, the government's needs for strategic services have frustrated that intent from the beginning.
The press received by the agency in countless articles, novels and other media have tended to create various popular myths; for example, that this agency replaced any intelligence effort other than that of the OSS, or that it contains the central intelligence capability of the United States.
In March 2014, the division's chairman, William Baer, recused himself because he was involved in a prior Comcast NBCUniversal acquisition.
Several states' attorneys general have announced support for the federal investigation.
On April 24, 2015, Jonathan Sallet, general counsel of the F.C.C., said that he was going to recommend a hearing before an administrative law judge, equivalent to a collapse of the deal.
The name may have been selected in reaction to the name of the Ming dynasty (明), which consists of the Chinese characters for "sun" (日) and "moon" (月),
The character Qīng (清) is composed of "water" (氵) and "azure" (青), both associated with the water element.
Daicing gurun may therefore have meant "warrior state", a pun that was only intelligible to Manchu and Mongol people.

It was defected Ming Han Chinese armies which conquered southern China for the Qing.
Elliott posted the facts of the incident, along with a copy of the bill, on his blog.
For example, "Near Eastern Languages" in the ancient sense includes such languages as Sumerian and Akkadian.
In the modern sense, it is likely to mean any or all of the Arabic languages.
We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened.
Zhejiang was the site of the Neolithic cultures of the Hemudu and Liangzhu.
Most infections do not have symptoms, known as latent tuberculosis.
This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control, it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily.
Hong Taiji died suddenly in September 1643 without a designated heir.
According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was located in northern Zhejiang.
Symptoms may include chest pain and a prolonged cough producing sputum.
Occasionally, people may cough up blood in small amounts, and in very rare cases, the infection may erode into the pulmonary artery or a Rasmussen's aneurysm, resulting in massive bleeding.
With no southern power to turn against Yue, Chu opposed it directly and, in 333 BC, succeeded in destroying it.
Despite the removal of their court from Kuaiji to Jianye (present-day Nanjing), they continued development of the region and benefitted from influxes of refugees fleeing the turmoil in northern China.
Zhejiang was part of the Wu during the Three Kingdoms.
When it spreads to the bones, it is also known as "osseous tuberculosis", a form of osteomyelitis.
The high lipid content of this pathogen accounts for many of its unique clinical characteristics.
Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River.

The lands of Galicia are ascribed to two different areas in the Köppen climate classification: a south area (roughly, the province of Ourense and Pontevedra) with tendencies to have some summer drought, classified as a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb), with mild temperatures and rainfall usual throughout the year; and the western and northern coastal regions, the provinces of Lugo and A Coruña, which are characterized by their Oceanic climate (Cfb), with a more uniform precipitation distribution along the year, and milder summers.
However, precipitation in southern coastal areas are often classified as oceanic since the averages remain significantly higher than a typical mediterranean climate.
As an example, Santiago de Compostela, the political capital city, has an average of 129 rainy days and 1,362 millimetres (53.6 in) per year (with just 17 rainy days in the three summer months) and 2,101 sunlight hours per year, with just 6 days with frosts per year.
The more mountainous parts of the provinces of Ourense and Lugo receive significant snowfall during the winter months.
This may be calcified to form structures like shells, bones, and spicules.
This traditional breakdown into such small areas is unusual when compared to the rest of Spain.
It is estimated that Galicia has over a million named places, over 40,000 of them being communities.

It ran from O Carril, Vilagarcía de Arousa to Cornes, Conxo, Santiago de Compostela.
Galicia today has roughly 1,100 kilometres (680 mi) of rail lines.
It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber, and two separate germ layers — an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm.
These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs.
The number of people working in the Tertiary and Quaternary sectors of the economy has increased significantly.
The name comes from the posterior location of the flagellum in motile cells, such as most animal spermatozoa, whereas other eukaryotes tend to have anterior flagella.
For the most part, they are bilaterally symmetric, and often have a specialized head with feeding and sensory organs.

Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years.
From the Iron Age, Galicia has a rich heritage based mainly on a great number of Hill forts, few of them excavated like Baroña, Sta.
They include the Brachiopoda or lamp shells, which are prominent in the fossil record, the Entoprocta, the Phoronida, and possibly the Bryozoa or moss animals.
They lack the complex organization found in most other phyla.
The population of the city of A Coruña in 1900 was 43,971.
A Coruña's growth occurred after the Spanish Civil War at the same speed as other major Galician cities, but it was the arrival of democracy in Spain after the death of Francisco Franco when A Coruña left all the other Galician cities behind.
Portugal is home to fifteen UNESCO World Heritage Sites, ranking it 8th in Europe and 17th in the world.
For well over a century Galicia has grown more slowly than the rest of Spain, due largely to emigration to Latin America and to other parts of Spain.
Adventurer and poet Luís de Camões (c. 1524–1580) wrote the epic poem "Os Lusíadas" (The Lusiads), with Virgil's Aeneid as his main influence.
The other platyzoan phyla are mostly microscopic and pseudocoelomate.
These groups share the presence of complex jaws, from which they are called the Gnathifera.

Today, the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes.
A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company.
Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.
Nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch.
Apple Inc.'s iMac was the first mainstream product with USB and the iMac's success popularized USB itself.
The group ended up creating a new USB version, USB 3.1, which was released on 31 July 2013, introducing a faster transfer mode called SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbit/s, putting it on par with a single first-generation Thunderbolt channel.
Additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content, and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer (primarily "light" beers) to convert more complex carbohydrates (starches) to fermentable sugars.
Low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content.
Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call "humane" or "polite" learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia.
Full-featured USB Type-C cables are active, electronically marked cables that contain a chip with an ID function based on the configuration data channel and vendor-defined messages (VDMs) from the USB Power Delivery 2.0 specification.
The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to "drop" (clear) again, as well as to fully condition—this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days.
Modern scholars, however, point out that Cicero (106 – 43 BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas, in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries.
Up to 127 devices, including hub devices if present, may be connected to a single host controller.

A USB device could have up to 32 endpoints (16 IN, 16 OUT), though it's rare to have so many.
Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the Gathas of Zarathustra, composed between 1,000 BCE – 600 BCE in Greater Iran.
Zarathustra's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from Ahura Mazda (God in the form of supreme wisdom).
Sage kings such as Yao and Shun are humanistic figures as recorded.[citation needed]
USB implements connections to storage devices using a set of standards called the USB mass storage device class (MSC or UMS).
A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley.
The first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as Adalard of Corbie, though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century.

The name Porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of London.
Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was designed by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, at the level of files rather than disk blocks.
The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.
Converters also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to a USB port.
For the next 70 years, however, neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way.
USB does not support cyclic networks and the standard connectors from incompatible USB devices are themselves incompatible.
It is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle.
But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself.
Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith (see Christian Humanism).
However the idea that these changes did in fact make the connector more durable in real world use has been widely disputed, with many contending that they are in fact, much less durable.
In Africa, there are various ethnic beers made from sorghum or millet, such as Oshikundu in Namibia and Tella in Ethiopia.
In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery.
In general, USB cables have only plugs on their ends, while hosts and devices have only receptacles.
Unlike sake, mould was not used to saccharify the rice (amylolytic fermentation); the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting.
The starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer.

The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries.
The history of breweries has been one of absorbing smaller breweries in order to ensure economy of scale.
In 2007, SABMiller surpassed InBev and Anheuser-Bush when it acquired Royal Grolsch, brewer of Dutch premium beer brand Grolsch in 2007.
The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and leaving the world a better place for those who come after.
Drinking games, such as beer pong, are also popular.
The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation.
Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.
Beer was spread through Europe by Germanic and Celtic tribes as far back as 3000 BC, and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale.
Every device functions initially as low-power (including high-power functions during their low-power enumeration phases), but may request high-power, and get it if available on the providing bus.

On some laptops such as Dell and Apple MacBook models, it is possible to plug a device in, close the laptop (putting it into sleep mode) and have the device continue to charge.[citation needed]
Instead, they were given special instructions for reporting the race of interracial persons.
Most significantly, respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race categories to indicate racial identities.
Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest-known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart.
The Interagency Committee agreed, stating that "race" and "ethnicity" were not sufficiently defined and "that many respondents conceptualize 'race' and 'ethnicity' as one in the same  [sic] underscor[ing] the need to consolidate these terms into one category, using a term that is more meaningful to the American people."
The racial categories represent a social-political construct for the race or races that respondents consider themselves to be and "generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country."
Geologically, the Paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called Pannotia and at the end of a global ice age.
The race categories include both racial and national-origin groups.
Among the changes, OMB issued the instruction to "mark one or more races" after noting evidence of increasing numbers of interracial children and wanting to capture the diversity in a measurable way and having received requests by people who wanted to be able to acknowledge their or their children's full ancestry rather than identifying with only one group.
Mask Tests, also known as Eye Diagram Tests, are used to determine the quality of a signal in the time domain.
The first byte is a packet identifier (PID) byte.
Although used in the Census and the American Community Survey, "Some other race" is not an official race, and the Bureau considered eliminating it prior to the 2000 Census.
Handshake packets consist of only a single PID byte, and are generally sent in response to data packets.
"Data on ethnic groups are important for putting into effect a number of federal statutes (i.e., enforcing bilingual election rules under the Voting Rights Act; monitoring and enforcing equal employment opportunities under the Civil Rights Act).
Error detection is provided by transmitting four bits that represent the packet type twice, in a single PID byte using complemented form.
Three basic types are ACK, indicating that data was successfully received, NAK, indicating that the data cannot be received and should be retried, and STALL, indicating that the device has an error condition and cannot transfer data until some corrective action (such as device initialization) occurs.
" The Census Bureau defines "Hispanic or Latino" as "a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race."
The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere.
The deep, enormous Panthalassa (the "universal ocean") covered the rest of the planet.
When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion).
Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common.
In the past, "paper money" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the "double eagle", discontinued in the 1930s).
The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) standard specifies a more elaborate power negotiation scheme than powered USB.
It operates at 48 V DC and can supply more power (up to 12.95 W, PoE+ 25.5 W) over a cable up to 100 meters compared to USB 2.0, which provides 2.5 W with a maximum cable length of 5 meters.
Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow Ural Ocean (which was closed by the collision of Baltica, and Siberia continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.
This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.
Even though USB 3.0's 4.5 W is sometimes insufficient to power external hard drives, technology is advancing and external drives gradually need less power, diminishing the eSATA advantage.
HSIC uses two signals at 1.2 V and has a throughput of 480 Mbit/s.
The early currency of the United States did not exhibit faces of presidents, as is the custom now; although today, by law, only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States currency.
In fact, the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency, a practice compared to the policies of European monarchs.
The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart.
During the Cretaceous, the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents, although their positions were substantially different at the time.
Based on the success of the "50 State Quarters" series, the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations, starting with George Washington, on the obverse side.
To allow for larger, more detailed portraits, the traditional inscriptions of "E Pluribus Unum", "In God We Trust", the year of minting or issuance, and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face.
In addition, due to the nature of U.S. coins, this will be the first time there will be circulating U.S. coins of different denominations with the same president featured on the obverse (heads) side (Lincoln/penny, Jefferson/nickel, Franklin D. Roosevelt/dime, Washington/quarter, Kennedy/half dollar, and Eisenhower/dollar).
The Cenozoic Era covers the 66 million years since the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event up to and including the present day.
The Tethys Sea, which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India, began to close up, forming the Mediterranean sea.
In response to the resistance from local elites, he massacred a large native population.
There is ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero inflation (which would mean a constant value for the U.S. dollar over time) or low, stable inflation (which would mean a continuously but slowly declining value of the dollar over time, as is the case now).
The $50 note is occasionally called a "yardstick" or a "grant" (after President Ulysses S. Grant, pictured on the obverse).
The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma (ICS 2004).
Sichuan has been historically known as the "Province of Abundance".
Because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins, the production of new Presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on December 13, 2011, by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.
The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000 years.
Ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 metres (115 ft) in the early part of the Holocene.
The U.S. dollar may therefore be described as the unit of account of the United States.
Currently printed denominations are $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100.
These notes are now collectors' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors.
The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility.
In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property.
It is still used to refer to the U.S. dollar (but not to the dollars of other countries).
The dollar was first based on the value and look of the Spanish dollar, used widely in Spanish America from the 16th to the 19th centuries.

Peel decided to standardise the police force as an official paid profession, to organise it in a civilian fashion, and to make it answerable to the public.
The 1829 Metropolitan Police Act created a modern police force by limiting the purview of the force and its powers, and envisioning it as merely an organ of the judicial system.
As of June 2015[update], the most recent version is Unicode 8.0.
Technically, all these coins are still legal tender at face value, though some are far more valuable today for their numismatic value, and for gold and silver coins, their precious metal value.
The merger of these two police forces in 1920 formed the world-famous Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
In the American Old West, policing was often of very poor quality.[citation needed]
At its height, the Pinkerton Agency's numbers exceeded those of the United States Army.[citation needed]
Foucault cites Magdalene Humpert author of Bibliographie der Kameralwissenschaften (1937) in which the author makes note of a substantial bibliography was produced of over 4000 pieces of the practice of Polizeiwissenschaft however, this maybe a mistranslation of Foucault's own work the actual source of Magdalene Humpert states over 14,000 items were produced from the 16th century dates ranging from 1520-1850.
Edwin Chadwick's 1829 article, "Preventive police" in the London Review, argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body, which was not the case in practice.
For example, in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross-border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals.
It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception.
Not a lot of empirical work on the practices of inter/transnational information and intelligence sharing has been undertaken.
An encoding maps (possibly a subset of) the range of Unicode code points to sequences of values in some fixed-size range, termed code values.
The same character converted to UTF-8 becomes the byte sequence EF BB BF.
The club has been highly successful, with many wins at Henley Royal Regatta including most recently in 2013 with victory in The Prince Albert Challenge Cup event.
The Unicode Standard allows that the BOM "can serve as signature for UTF-8 encoded text where the character set is unmarked".
Some software developers have adopted it for other encodings, including UTF-8, in an attempt to distinguish UTF-8 from local 8-bit code pages.
For example, according to the Global Accountability Report for 2007 (Lloyd, et al.
In the other encodings, each code point may be represented by a variable number of code values.
The UK Energy Research Centre was also established in 2004 and opened its headquarters at Imperial College.
Imperial's main campus is located in the South Kensington area of central London.
Unmarked vehicles are used primarily for sting operations or apprehending criminals without alerting them to their presence.
Some police forces use unmarked or minimally marked cars for traffic law enforcement, since drivers slow down at the sight of marked police vehicles and unmarked vehicles make it easier for officers to catch speeders and traffic violators.
Thus, in many cases, users have multiple ways of encoding the same character.
Furthermore, in terms of job prospects, as of 2014 the average starting salary of an Imperial graduate was the highest of any UK university.
However, attempts to do this for character encoding have stumbled over the fact that ideographs do not decompose as simply or as regularly as Hangul does.
O.W. Wilson, a student of Vollmer, helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in Wichita, Kansas, and later in the Chicago Police Department.
In Miranda the court created safeguards against self-incriminating statements made after an arrest.
This means that a newly appointed constable has the same arrest powers as a Chief Constable or Commissioner.
By formally recognizing the act of genocide as a crime, involves the undergoing prosecution that begins with not only seeing genocide as outrageous past any moral standpoint but also may be a legal liability within international relations.
Thousands of fonts exist on the market, but fewer than a dozen fonts—sometimes described as "pan-Unicode" fonts—attempt to support the majority of Unicode's character repertoire.
Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust was formed on 1 October 2007 by the merger of Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust (Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital) and St Mary's NHS Trust (St. Mary's Hospital and Western Eye Hospital) with Imperial College London Faculty of Medicine.
The Trust is currently the largest in the UK and has an annual turnover of £800 million, treating more than a million patients a year.[citation needed]
This is achieved with the Cocoa text system in Mac OS X and also with W3C XML and HTML recommendations.
There have been several attempts to create alternative encodings that preserve the stylistic differences between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters in opposition to Unicode's policy of Han unification.
(2 August 2001) that Genocide had been committed.
Imperial acquired Silwood Park in 1947, to provide a site for research and teaching in those aspects of biology not well suited for the main London campus.
The intent to destroy formed by a perpetrator of genocide will always be limited by the opportunity presented to him.
The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708.

St. John's had the seventh-highest metropolitan crime index and twelfth-highest metropolitan violent crime index in the country in 2010.
International locations include Dublin, London, New York City, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Glasgow and Varadero.
The divided highway, also known as "Outer Ring Road" in the city, runs just outside the main part of the city, with exits to Pitts Memorial Drive, Topsail Road, Team Gushue Highway, Thorburn Road, Allandale Road, Portugal Cove Road and Torbay Road, providing relatively easy access to neighbourhoods served by those streets.
John attempted to address some of the problems with the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage, improving its quality and consistency.
Metrobus Transit is responsible for public transit in the region.
CBC has its Newfoundland and Labrador headquarters in the city and their television station CBNT-DT broadcasts from University Avenue.
St. John's is the only Canadian city served by radio stations whose call letters do not all begin with the letter C.
When he returned to England, John faced a rebellion by many of his barons, who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England's most powerful nobles.
Civil war broke out shortly afterwards, with the barons aided by Louis of France.
John would become a "connoisseur of jewels", building up a large collection, and became famous for his opulent clothes and also, according to French chroniclers, for his fondness for bad wine.
Miksa's father and grandfather were both born in Ond (now part of the town of Szerencs), Zemplén County, northern Hungary.
From the 1040s onwards, however, successive popes had put forward a reforming message that emphasised the importance of the church being "governed more coherently and more hierarchically from the centre" and established "its own sphere of authority and jurisdiction, separate from and independent of that of the lay ruler", in the words of historian Richard Huscroft.
A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased.
The school system produced a generation noted for intellectual achievement, that included Theodore von Kármán (b. 1881), George de Hevesy (
(b. 1898), Eugene Wigner (b. 1902), Edward Teller (b. 1908), and Paul Erdős (b. 1913).
Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at the Lutheran School.
On their first meeting, Szegő was so astounded with the boy's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears.
Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar.
He agreed to set aside his wife, Isabella of Gloucester, and marry Philip's sister, Alys, in exchange for Philip's support.
None of the family had converted to Christianity while he was alive, but afterwards they all did.
Contemporary chroniclers argued that John had fallen deeply in love with Isabella, and John may have been motivated by desire for an apparently beautiful, if rather young, girl.
John's position in France was considerably strengthened by the victory at Mirebeau, but John's treatment of his new prisoners and of his ally, William de Roches, quickly undermined these gains.
However, Gödel had already discovered this consequence, now known as his second incompleteness theorem and sent von Neumann a preprint of his article containing both incompleteness theorems.
William de Roches and other of John's regional allies in Anjou and Brittany deserted him in favour of Philip, and Brittany rose in fresh revolt.
Von Neumann acknowledged Gödel's priority in his next letter.
In the aftermath of John's death William Marshal was declared the protector of the nine-year-old Henry III.
Von Neumann was motivated by his discovery of von Neumann algebras with a dimension function taking a continuous range of dimensions, and the first example of a continuous geometry other than projective space was the projections of the hyperfinite type II factor.
The work of Banach had implied that the problem of measure has a positive solution if n = 1 or n = 2 and a negative solution in all other cases.
He derived income from fines, court fees and the sale of charters and other privileges.
One of von Neumann's analyses was to reduce the classification of von Neumann algebras on separable Hilbert spaces to the classification of factors.
John increased the professionalism of local sergeants and bailiffs, and extended the system of coroners first introduced by Hubert Walter in 1194, creating a new class of borough coroners.
John worked extremely hard to ensure that this system operated well, through judges he had appointed, by fostering legal specialists and expertise, and by intervening in cases himself.
Numerous barons were subjected to John's malevolentia, even including William Marshal, a famous knight and baron normally held up as a model of utter loyalty.
Bub also suggests that von Neumann was aware of this limitation, and that von Neumann did not claim that his proof completely ruled out hidden variable theories.
From Henry II onwards, ira et malevolentia had come to describe the right of the king to express his anger and displeasure at particular barons or clergy, building on the Norman concept of malevoncia – royal ill-will.
This effectively crippled William's power north of the border, and by 1212 John had to intervene militarily to support the Scottish king against his internal rivals.[nb 16]
For his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann proved the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium using his generalization of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem.
In this model, the (transposed) probability vector p represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the "intensity" at which the production process would run.
When this threat failed, Innocent excommunicated the king in November 1209.
Von Neumann's results have been viewed as a special case of linear programming, where von Neumann's model uses only nonnegative matrices.
Two of John's close allies, Emperor Otto IV and Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, had already suffered the same punishment themselves, and the significance of excommunication had been somewhat devalued.
Neither John nor the rebel barons seriously attempted to implement the peace accord.
The failure of the agreement led rapidly to the First Barons' War.
Accounts of the incident vary considerably between the various chroniclers and the exact location of the incident has never been confirmed; the losses may have involved only a few of his pack-horses.
The actual power of the explosion had been between 20 and 22 kilotons.
After the war, Robert Oppenheimer remarked that the physicists involved in the Manhattan project had "known sin".
One group of chroniclers wrote early in John's life, or around the time of his accession, including Richard of Devizes, William of Newburgh, Roger of Hoveden and Ralph de Diceto.
The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death.
Because using lists of "truly" random numbers was extremely slow, von Neumann developed a form of making pseudorandom numbers, using the middle-square method.
In 1195 John successfully conducted a sudden attack and siege of Évreux castle, and subsequently managed the defences of Normandy against Philip.
The paper, whose premature distribution nullified the patent claims of EDVAC designers J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, described a computer architecture in which the data and the program are both stored in the computer's memory in the same address space.
Some of von Neumann's early computer programs have been preserved.
John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard.
Philip moved south around the new defensive line and struck upwards at the heart of the Duchy, now facing little resistance.
He also created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper.
John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay.
Von Neumann's interest in weather systems and meteorological prediction led him to propose manipulating the environment by spreading colorants on the polar ice caps to enhance absorption of solar radiation (by reducing the albedo).
The feeling was you were on a tricycle chasing a racing car."
The specific accusations made against John during the baronial revolts are now generally considered to have been invented for the purposes of justifying the revolt; nonetheless, most of John's contemporaries seem to have held a poor opinion of his sexual behaviour.[nb 14]
Herman Goldstine wrote: "One of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall.
In January 1216 John marched against Alexander II of Scotland, who had allied himself with the rebel cause.
A new sarcophagus with an effigy was made for him in 1232, in which his remains now rest.
Historians in the "Whiggish" tradition, focusing on documents such as the Domesday Book and Magna Carta, trace a progressive and universalist course of political and economic development in England over the medieval period.
The console was originally planned for a global release through November, but at the start of September the release in Europe and the rest of the world was delayed until March.

Among the titles available in the budget range include Resistance: Fall of Man, MotorStorm, Uncharted: Drakes Fortune, Rainbow Six
This was first demonstrated publicly on PS3 using Sony's own technology in January 2009 at the Consumer Electronics Show.
System software update 3.50 prepared it for 3D films.
The historian Lewis Warren has argued that the chronicler accounts were subject to considerable bias and the King was "at least conventionally devout," citing his pilgrimages and interest in religious scripture and commentaries.
Philip seized the initiative in 1213, sending his elder son, Louis, to invade Flanders with the intention of next launching an invasion of England.
Retail PS3 Slim units cannot be used for supercomputing, because PS3 Slim lacks the ability to boot into a third-party OS.
To complicate matters, the bishops of the province of Canterbury also claimed the right to appoint the next archbishop.
The chapter secretly elected Reginald and he travelled to Rome to be confirmed; the bishops challenged the appointment and the matter was taken before Innocent.
At its press conference at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, Sony announced DualShock 3 (trademarked DUALSHOCK 3), a PlayStation 3 controller with the same function and design as Sixaxis, but with vibration capability included.
Many of John's military household joined the rebels, particularly amongst those that John had appointed to administrative roles across England; their local links and loyalties outweighed their personal loyalty to John.
TheTV/Video Services category is for services like Netflix and/or if PlayTV or torne is installed; the first category in this section is "My Channels", which lets users download various streaming services, including Sony's own streaming services Crackle and PlayStation Vue.
For some the appointment of Peter des Roches as justiciar was an important factor, as he was considered an "abrasive foreigner" by many of the barons.
Since June 2009 VidZone has offered a free music video streaming service in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
A paid Netflix subscription was required for the service.
The firmware update 3.21 was mandatory for access to the PlayStation Network.
Sony stated that the affected models incorrectly identified 2010 as a leap year, because of a bug in the BCD method of storing the date.
By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000, but increased its speed from 5 MHz to 8 MHz; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256-pixel display.

In September 1986, Apple introduced the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, or MPW, an application that allowed software developers to create software for Macintosh on Macintosh, rather than cross compiling from a Lisa.
The service is accessible through an icon on the XMB on PS3 and PSP.
The PS3 store can also be accessed on PSP via a Remote Play connection to PS3.
Users can edit and decorate their personal apartments, avatars or club houses with free, premium or won content.
The decision caused significant financial losses for companies like Motorola, who produced the StarMax; Umax, who produced the SuperMac; and Power Computing, who offered several lines of Mac clones, including the PowerWave, PowerTower, and PowerTower Pro.
Apple bought out Power Computing's license, but allowed Umax to continue selling Mac clones until their license expired, as they had a sizeable presence in the lower-end segment that Apple did not.
From its beginnings on an 8 MHz machine with 128 KB of RAM, it had grown to support Apple's latest 1 GHz G4-equipped Macs.
Older Mac OS applications could still run under early Mac OS X versions, using an environment called "Classic".
Apple introduced an emulator during the transition from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), much as it did during the transition from Motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier.
However, market analysts Nikko Citigroup have predicted that PlayStation 3 could be profitable by August 2008.
The PS3 has always been a brilliant games console," and that "For now, this is just about the best media device for the money."
Just say, 'This was a horrible disaster and we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'".
He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks (Valve's system to automatically update their software independently) would help to make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market.
Ive continues to guide products towards a minimalist and simple feel, including eliminating of replaceable batteries in notebooks.

TechRadar gave PS3 Slim four and a half stars out of five praising its new smaller size and summed up its review stating "Over all, the PS3 Slim is a phenomenal piece of kit.
However, royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent.
In the vast majority of contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their ruler to withhold the royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government.
In 1265, the Earl of Leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation.
The body eventually came to be divided into two branches: bishops, abbots, earls, and barons formed the House of Lords, while the shire and borough representatives formed the House of Commons.
The Macintosh ranked third on the "list of intended brands for desktop purchases" for the 2011 holiday season, then moved up to second in 2012 by displacing Hewlett Packard, and in 2013 took the top spot ahead of Dell.
It also offered an upgrade for 128k Macs that involved replacing the logic board.
During the rule of the succeeding Hanoverian dynasty, power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government.
This succeeded in increasing the Macintosh's market share somewhat, and provided cheaper hardware for consumers, but hurt Apple financially as existing Apple customers began to buy cheaper clones which cannibalized the sales of Apple's higher-margin Macintosh systems, yet Apple still shouldered the burden of developing the Mac OS platform.
Royal assent is not sufficient to give legal effect to an Act of Tynwald.
Apple introduced Mac OS X 10.8 in February, and it was made available in the summer of 2012.
" users by software update), Launchpad, an application viewer and launcher akin to the iOS Home Screen, and Resume, a feature similar to the hibernate function found in Microsoft Windows.
In Australia, a technical issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001.
Initially, Apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the malware or admit the existence of the malware issue, but as the malware spread, a support document was issued.
After 1765, royal assent was at first signified by letter from the Secretary of State to the governor; but, during the British Regency, the practice began of granting royal assent by Order in Council, which continues to this day, though limited to exceptional cases since 1981.
Since the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931, the all Commonwealth realms have been sovereign kingdoms, the monarch and governors-general acting solely on the advice of the local ministers who generally maintain the support of the legislature and are the ones who secure the passage of bills.
Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization.
In 1989, Jean-Louis Gassée had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers, then there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry that year, forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices which dropped Apple's margins.
Officially, assent is granted by the sovereign or by Lords Commissioners authorised to act by letters patent.
It may be granted in parliament or outside parliament; in the latter case, each house must be separately notified before the bill takes effect.
For the next half-decade while Macintosh sales held steady, it would instead be the iPod portable music player and iTunes music download service that would drive Apple's sales growth.

Only about ten applications including MacWrite and MacPaint were widely available, although many non-Apple software developers participated in the introduction and Apple promised that 79 companies including Lotus, Digital Research, and Ashton-Tate were creating products for the new computer.
Microsoft Windows 3.0 was released in May 1990, and according to a common saying at the time "Windows was not as good as Macintosh, but it was good enough for the average user".
In late 1991, as the higher-end Macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the '040, Apple was unable to offer the '040 in their top-of-the-line PowerBooks until early 1994 with the PowerBook 500 series, several years after the first 486-powered IBM compatible laptops hit the market which cost Apple considerable sales.
The Power Macintosh line, the first to use the new chips, proved to be highly successful, with over a million PowerPC units sold in nine months.
In Canada, the traditional ceremony for granting assent in parliament was regularly used until the 21st century, long after it had been discontinued in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms.
Its translucent plastic case, originally Bondi blue and later various additional colors, is considered an industrial design landmark of the late 1990s.
It replaced a floppy disk drive with a CD-ROM drive for installing software, but was incapable of writing to CDs or other media without external third-party hardware.
More than 140,000 pre-orders were placed before it started shipping in September, and by October proved to be a large success.

Articles 77–79 of the Norwegian Constitution specifically grant the monarch of Norway the right to withhold royal assent from any bill passed by the Storting.
During the bombing raid, private Radoje Ljutovac fired his cannon at the enemy aircraft and successfully shot one down.
The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.
The cannon Ljutovac used was not designed as an anti-aircraft gun, it was a slightly modified Turkish cannon captured during the First Balkan War in 1912.
Modern group theory—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right.a[›]
Furthermore, in Britain the volunteer Observer Corps formed in 1925 provided a network of observation posts to report hostile aircraft flying over Britain.
For example, r1 sends a point to its rotation 90° clockwise around the square's center, and fh sends a point to its reflection across the square's vertical middle line.
On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation θn = 1 (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a finite group.
The interceptor aircraft (or simply interceptor) is a type of fighter aircraft designed specifically to intercept and destroy enemy aircraft, particularly bombers, usually relying on high speed and altitude capabilities.
Although air planners have imagined lasers in combat since the late 1960s, only the most modern laser systems are currently reaching what could be considered "experimental usefulness".
Area air defence, the air defence of a specific area or location, (as opposed to point defence), have historically been operated by both armies (Anti-Aircraft Command in the British Army, for instance) and Air Forces (the United States Air Force's CIM-10 Bomarc).
By the mentioned principle, they are required to respect the group structures in a precise sense.
g for any g in G and h in H. From an abstract point of view, isomorphic groups carry the same information.
For example, proving that g • g = 1G for some element
During the Cold War the runways and taxiways of some airfields were painted green.
The subgroup test is a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset H of a group G to be a subgroup: it is sufficient to check that g−1h ∈ H for all elements g, h ∈ H. Knowing
These batteries, particularly with guns, usually deploy in a small area, although batteries may be split; this is usual for some missile systems.
Two assumptions underpinned the British approach to HAA fire; first, aimed fire was the primary method and this was enabled by predicting gun data from visually tracking the target and having its height.
By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups.i[›] For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops.
In the picture, multiplying with z corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation by 60°.
The maximum distance at which a gun or missile can engage an aircraft is an important figure.
One term is 'ceiling', maximum ceiling being the height a projectile would reach if fired vertically, not practically useful in itself as few AA guns are able to fire vertically, and maximum fuse duration may be too short, but potentially useful as a standard to compare different weapons.
By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.
An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectic state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.
Another application is differential Galois theory, which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved.u[›]
Similar formulae are known for cubic and quartic equations, but do not exist in general for degree 5 and higher.
The number of elements is called the order of the group.
However, effective ceiling for heavy AA guns was affected by non-ballistic factors:
An intermediate step is the classification of finite simple groups.r[›]
However, during the Second World War the RAF Regiment was formed to protect airfields everywhere, and this included light air defences.
Such groups are called topological groups, and they are the group objects in the category of topological spaces.
During World War II the Royal Marines also provided air defence units; formally part of the mobile naval base defence organisation, they were handled as an integral part of the army-commanded ground based air defences.
Invariance means, in the case of real numbers for example:
By the early 20th century balloon, or airship, guns, for land and naval use were attracting attention.
The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of space time in special relativity.
The natural numbers N (including 0) under addition form a monoid, as do the nonzero integers under multiplication (Z ∖ {0}, ·), see above.
The British Army adopted the 13-pounder quickly producing new mountings suitable for AA use, the 13-pdr QF 6 cwt Mk III was issued in 1915.
The table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups.
The Treaty of Versailles prevented Germany having AA weapons, and for example, the Krupps designers joined Bofors in Sweden.
Poland's AA defences were no match for the German attack and the situation was similar in other European countries.
In addition the RAF regiment was formed in 1941 with responsibility for airfield air defence, eventually with Bofors 40mm as their main armament.
At the same time the Royal Navy adopted a new 4.5-inch (114 mm) gun in a twin turret, which the army adopted in simplified single-gun mountings for static positions, mostly around ports where naval ammunition was available.
However, the performance of both 3.7 and 4.5-in guns was limited by their standard fuse No 199, with a 30-second running time, although a new mechanical time fuse giving 43 seconds was nearing readiness.
New forms of forced labor were also introduced and a large number of Ubangians were sent to work on the Congo-Ocean Railway.
In 1946 Barthélémy Boganda was elected with 9,000 votes to the French National Assembly, becoming the first representative for CAR in the French government.
Boganda maintained a political stance against racism and the colonial regime but gradually became disheartened with the French political system and returned to CAR to establish the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN) in 1950.
The Germans developed massive reinforced concrete blockhouses, some more than six stories high, which were known as Hochbunker "High Bunkers" or "Flaktürme" flak towers, on which they placed anti-aircraft artillery.
Those in cities attacked by the Allied land forces became fortresses.
In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patassé's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension.
The firing of one of these devices during an air raid is suspected to have caused the Bethnal Green disaster in 1943.
In November 2006, Bozizé's government requested French military support to help them repel rebels who had taken control of towns in the country's northern regions.
Although Germany had been desperate to introduce anti-aircraft missile systems, none became operational during World War II.
The security situation did not improve during June–August 2013 and there were reports of over 200,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) as well as human rights abuses and renewed fighting between Séléka and Bozizé supporters.
The same thing occurred in the USSR after the introduction of their SA-2 Guideline systems.
The per capita income of the Republic is often listed as being approximately $400 a year, one of the lowest in the world, but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of exports and largely ignores the unregistered sale of foods, locally produced alcoholic beverages, diamonds, ivory, bushmeat, and traditional medicine.
Agriculture is dominated by the cultivation and sale of food crops such as cassava, peanuts, maize, sorghum, millet, sesame, and plantain.
Food crops are not exported in large quantities, but still constitute the principal cash crops of the country, because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus food crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee.[citation needed]
The 2009 Human Rights Report by the United States Department of State noted that human rights in CAR were poor and expressed concerns over numerous government abuses.
In the United States Army for instance, air defence is part of the artillery arm, while in the Pakistan Army, it was split off from Artillery to form a separate arm of its own in 1990.
This is in contrast to some (largely communist or ex-communist) countries where not only are there provisions for air defence in the army, navy and air force but there are specific branches that deal only with the air defence of territory, for example, the Soviet PVO Strany.
It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.
These may be deployed at regiment-level and consist of platoons of self-propelled anti-aircraft platforms, whether they are self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (SPAAGs), integrated air-defence systems like Tunguska or all-in-one surface-to-air missile platforms like Roland or SA-8 Gecko.
It is an arms race; as better jamming, countermeasures and anti-radiation weapons are developed, so are better SAM systems with ECCM capabilities and the ability to shoot down anti-radiation missiles and other munitions aimed at them or the targets they are defending.
Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may have marked and persistent symptoms.
Other terms from the late 20th century include GBAD (Ground Based AD) with related terms SHORAD (Short Range AD) and MANPADS ("Man Portable AD Systems": typically shoulder-launched missiles).
At the start of the 20th century these were either very primitive or non-existent.
The hygiene hypothesis attempts to explain the increased rates of asthma worldwide as a direct and unintended result of reduced exposure, during childhood, to non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses.
The naval 3-inch was also adopted by the army, the QF 3 inch 20 cwt (76 mm), a new field mounting was introduced in 1916.
Many of these genes are related to the immune system or modulating inflammation.
Operators simply fed the guns and selected the targets.
Also available to the Americans at the start of the war was the 120 mm M1 gun stratosphere gun, which was the most powerful AA gun with an impressive 60,000 ft (18 km) altitude capability.
The 90 mm and 120 mm guns would continue to be used into the 1950s.
The 419th and 601st Antiaircraft Gun Battalions of the US Army were first allocated to the Folkestone-Dover coast to defend London, and then moved to Belgium to become part of the "Antwerp X" project.
The SAMs launched by individuals are known in the United States as the Man-Portable Air Defence Systems (MANPADS).
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is common in professional athletes.
Potential targets, if they are military aircraft, will be identified as friend or foe before being engaged.
Multiple transmitter radars such as those from bistatic radars and low-frequency radars are said to have the capabilities to detect stealth aircraft.
A few hundred different agents have been implicated with the most common being: isocyanates, grain and wood dust, colophony, soldering flux, latex, animals, and aldehydes.
The newest SAM's have a claimed ability to be able to detect and engage stealth targets, with the most notable being the S-400, which is claimed to be able to detect a target with a 0.05 meter squared RCS from 90 km away.
Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can coexist with asthma and can occur as a complication of chronic asthma.
After the age of 65 most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD.
Roughly contemporary with the Brahmi, Kharosthi was used in the northwest of the subcontinent.
In East India, the Bengali alphabet, and, later, the Odia alphabet, were used.
Cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke (passive smoke) may reduce the effectiveness of medications such as corticosteroids.
The prognosis for asthma is generally good, especially for children with mild disease.
Globally it causes moderate or severe disability in 19.4 million people as of 2004 (16 million of which are in low and middle income countries).
Of asthma diagnosed during childhood, half of cases will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade.

As Pioneer introduced Digital Audio to LaserDisc in 1985, they further refined the CAA format.
In order to explain the common features shared by Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages, many scholars have proposed the Indo-Aryan migration theory, asserting that the original speakers of what became Sanskrit arrived in what is now India and Pakistan from the north-west some time during the early second millennium BCE.
Evidence for such a theory includes the close relationship between the Indo-Iranian tongues and the Baltic and Slavic languages, vocabulary exchange with the non-Indo-European Uralic languages, and the nature of the attested Indo-European words for flora and fauna.
The digital sound signal in both formats are EFM-encoded as in CD.
The "All-India Sanskrit Festival" (since 2002) holds composition contests.
DTS audio, when available on a disc, replaced the digital audio tracks; hearing DTS sound required only an S/PDIF compliant digital connection to a DTS decoder.
The Mattur village in central Karnataka claims to have native speakers of Sanskrit among its population.
Historically, the village was given by king Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire to Vedic scholars and their families, while people in his kingdom spoke Kannada and Telugu.
Later analog discs also applied CX Noise Reduction, which improved the signal-noise ratio of their audio.
If the player did not have an AC-3 output available, the next most attractive playback option would be the digital Dolby Surround or stereo audio tracks.
The reason for this is the RF signal needs to bypass the audio circuitry in order to be properly processed by the demodulator.
Valencia (/vəˈlɛnsiə/; Spanish: [baˈlenθja]), or València
Many 1990s A/V receivers combine the AC-3 decoder and DTS decoder logic, but an integrated AC-3 demodulator is rare both in LaserDisc players and in later A/V receivers.

In the mid-1980s Lucasfilm pioneered the EditDroid non-linear editing system for film and television based on computer-controlled LaserDisc players.
The player was referred as an LV-ROM (LaserVision Read Only Memory) as the discs contained the driving software as well as the video frames.
Apple's HyperCard scripting language provided Macintosh computer users with a means to design databases of slides, animation, video and sounds from LaserDiscs and then to create interfaces for users to play specific content from the disc through software called LaserStacks.
Under contract from the U.S. Military, Matrox produced a combination computer/LaserDisc player for instructional purposes.
Many of these were sold as surplus by the military during the 1990s, often without the controller software.
Encoded using NHK's MUSE "Hi-Vision" analogue TV system, MUSE discs would operate like standard LaserDiscs but would contain high-definition 1,125-line (1,035 visible lines)
The red laser was capable of reading through disc defects such as scratches and even mild disc rot that would cause most other players to stop, stutter or drop-out.
In order to view MUSE encoded discs, it was necessary to have a MUSE decoder in addition to a compatible player.
During the video transfer stage, the movie was stored in an anamorphic "squeezed" format.
This same procedure was used for anamorphic DVDs, but unlike all DVD players, very few LD players had the ability to unsqueeze the image for 4:3 sets, and very few if any 4:3 sets could be set to play them properly either.
Since very few people owned 16:9 displays, the marketability of these special discs was very limited.
Terminator 2 was released twice in Squeeze LD, the second release being THX certified and a notable improvement over the first.

The lower house of a federal legislature is usually directly elected, with apportionment in proportion to population, although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of seats.
Some scholars have suggested, however, that federalism can divide countries and result in state collapse because it creates proto-states.
Federalism in the United States is the evolving relationship between state governments and the federal government of the United States.

Although China has had long periods of central rule for centuries, it is often argued that the unitary structure of the Chinese government is far too unwieldy to effectively and equitably manage the country's affairs.
On the other hand, Chinese nationalists are suspicious of decentralization as a form of secessionism and a backdoor for national disunity; still others argue that the degree of autonomy given to provincial-level officials in the People's Republic of China amounts to a de facto federalism.

A few marine annelids that live in tubes lack cuticles, but their tubes have a similar structure, and mucus-secreting glands in the epidermis protect their skins.
Some annelids also have oblique internal muscles that connect the underside of the body to each side.
When the cheta is complete, the microvilli withdraw into the chetoblast, leaving parallel tunnels that run almost the full length of the cheta.
The French railway system, with multiple competing companies, had developed purely from commercial pressures and many journeys to the front in Alsace and Lorraine involved long diversions and frequent changes between trains.
Parapodia are unjointed paired extensions of the body wall, and their muscles are derived from the circular muscles of the body.
The brains of polychaetes are generally in the prostomium, while those of clitellates are in the peristomium or sometimes the first segment behind the peristomium.
However, in most polychaetes the two main nerve cords are fused, and in the tube-dwelling genus Owenia the single nerve chord has no ganglia and is located in the epidermis.

More recently leeches have been used to assist in microsurgery, and their saliva has provided anti-inflammatory compounds and several important anticoagulants, one of which also prevents tumors from spreading.
Until 2008 the earliest fossils widely accepted as annelids were the polychaetes Canadia and Burgessochaeta, both from Canada's Burgess Shale, formed about 505 million years ago in the early Cambrian.
By the end of the Carboniferous, about 299 million years ago, fossils of most of the modern mobile polychaete groups had appeared.
For many years there was no clear arrangement of the approximately 80 polychaete families into higher-level groups.
In addition, it also placed sipunculans, generally regarded at the time as a separate phylum, on another branch of the polychaete tree, and concluded that leeches were a sub-group of oligochaetes rather than their sister-group among the clitellates.
However, the genes that drive segmentation in arthropods do not appear to do the same in annelids.
The Chief of the General Staff, effectively the commander in chief of the Prussian army, was independent of the minister of war and answered only to the monarch.
This disorganization hampered the French commanders' ability to exercise control of their forces.
Hence this development pattern is often described as "spiral determinate cleavage".

A series of swift Prussian and German victories in eastern France, culminating in the Siege of Metz and the Battle of Sedan, saw the army of the Second Empire decisively defeated (Napoleon III had been captured at Sedan on 2 September).
Other historians, notably French historian Pierre Milza, dispute this.
To relieve pressure from the expected German attack into Alsace-Lorraine, Napoleon III and the French high command planned a seaborne invasion of northern Germany as soon as war began.
The Prussian Army was composed not of regulars but conscripts.
Service was compulsory for all of men of military age, and thus Prussia and its North and South German allies could mobilise and field some 1,000,000 soldiers in time of war.
Rather than advancing in a column or line formation, Prussian infantry moved in small groups that were harder to target by artillery or French defensive fire.
To the resulting lack of intelligence at the top can be ascribed all the inexcusable defects of French military policy."
A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the Siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led naval officers to be sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the Garde Mobile.

There are certain characteristics of adolescent development that are more rooted in culture than in human biology or cognitive structures.
For these reasons, culture is a prevalent and powerful presence in the lives of adolescents, and therefore we cannot fully understand today's adolescents without studying and understanding their culture.

For example, adolescents find it easier than children to comprehend the sorts of higher-order abstract logic inherent in puns, proverbs, metaphors, and analogies.
Their increased facility permits them to appreciate the ways in which language can be used to convey multiple messages, such as satire, metaphor, and sarcasm.
This situation is similar to other countries in Northern Europe.
In addressing this question, it is important to distinguish whether adolescents are more likely to engage in risky behaviors (prevalence), whether they make risk-related decisions similarly or differently than adults (cognitive processing perspective), or whether they use the same processes but value different things and thus arrive at different conclusions.
Further distinctions in self-concept, called "differentiation," occur as the adolescent recognizes the contextual influences on their own behavior and the perceptions of others, and begin to qualify their traits when asked to describe themselves.
This model has been contested, and alternate ideas have been explored in recent years.

Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere).
The Estonian literature refers to literature written in the Estonian language (ca.
As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting.
The domination of Estonia after the Northern Crusades, from the 13th century to 1918 by Germany, Sweden, and Russia resulted in few early written literary works in the Estonian language.
Among the most popular writers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries are Tõnu Õnnepalu and Andrus Kivirähk, who uses elements of Estonian folklore and mythology, deforming them into absurd and grotesque.

The capital city, Juneau, is situated on the mainland of the North American continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.
This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice.
Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent.
These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass.
During the whaling era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter.

Alaska's capital, which had been in Sitka until 1906, was moved north to Juneau.
European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska, where they entered the fishing and logging industries.
Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica.

Popper himself, in his autobiography, erroneously recalls that Herr Grübl's first name was Carl.)
In 1929, he obtained the authorisation to teach mathematics and physics in secondary school, which he started doing.
The Two Fundamental Problems of the Theory of Knowledge).
Here, he criticised psychologism, naturalism, inductionism, and logical positivism, and put forth his theory of potential falsifiability as the criterion demarcating science from non-science.
In 1937, Popper finally managed to get a position that allowed him to emigrate to New Zealand, where he became lecturer in philosophy at Canterbury University College of the University of New Zealand in Christchurch.
After cremation, his ashes were taken to Vienna and buried at Lainzer cemetery adjacent to the ORF Centre, where his wife Josefine Anna Popper (called ‘Hennie’) had already been buried.
The three levels of classification are: primary (P), secondary (S), and tertiary (T).
During the wet seasons these roads typically become impassable.
Popper thought that Einstein's theory, as a theory properly grounded in scientific thought and method, was highly "risky", in the sense that it was possible to deduce consequences from it which were, in the light of the then-dominant Newtonian physics, highly improbable (e.g., that light is deflected towards solid bodies—confirmed by Eddington's experiments in 1919), and which would, if they turned out to be false, falsify the whole theory.
In contrast, nothing could, even in principle, falsify psychoanalytic theories.
Among other things, the government's registration system requires religious groups to submit personal information on their membership to be allowed to worship.
This realisation had an important consequence when Popper later tackled the problem of demarcation in the philosophy of science, as it led him to posit that the strength of a scientific theory lies in its both being susceptible to falsification, and not actually being falsified by criticism made of it.
Popper coined the term "critical rationalism" to describe his philosophy.
While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium.
Yet, as it appears that the engine of biological evolution has, over many generations, produced adaptive traits equipped to deal with more and more complex problems of survival, likewise, the evolution of theories through the scientific method may, in Popper's view, reflect a certain type of progress: toward more and more interesting problems ().
He argued that historicism is founded upon mistaken assumptions regarding the nature of scientific law and prediction.
The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.
Popper writes of learning in 1935 of the consequences of Tarski's theory, to his intense joy.
Further work found that the far more common uranium-238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium, which, like uranium-235, is also fissile by thermal neutrons.
Natural uranium consists of three major isotopes: uranium-238 (99.28% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.71%), and uranium-234 (0.0054%).
Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties.
While uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons.
This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons.
After behaviour has changed radically, small but quick changes of the phenotype follow to make the organism fitter to its changed goals.
Popper contrasted this view as "evolution from within" or "active Darwinism" (the organism actively trying to discover new ways of life and being on a quest for conquering new ecological niches), with the naturalistic "evolution from without" (which has the picture of a hostile environment only trying to kill the mostly passive organism, or perhaps segregate some of its groups).
In an interview that Popper gave in 1969 with the condition that it shall be kept secret until after his death, he summarised his position on God as follows: "I don't know whether God exists or not. ...
Because of their stability, uranium oxides are generally considered the preferred chemical form for storage or disposal.
Popper founded in 1946 the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the London School of Economics and there lectured and influenced both Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend, two of the foremost philosophers of science in the next generation of philosophy of science.
(Lakatos significantly modified Popper's position,:1 and Feyerabend repudiated it entirely, but the work of both is deeply influenced by Popper and engaged with many of the problems that Popper set.)
On 2 December 1942, as part of the Manhattan Project, another team led by Enrico Fermi was able to initiate the first artificial self-sustained nuclear chain reaction, Chicago Pile-1.
The 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named the new element after the planet Uranus.
Theories that say more about the way things appear are to be preferred over those that do not; the more generally applicable a theory is, the greater its value.
High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average.
For instance, atomic theory implies that all metals melt at some temperature.
Popper, the historian of ideas and his scholarship, is criticised in some academic quarters for his rejection of Plato, Hegel and Marx.
Initially it was believed that uranium was relatively rare, and that nuclear proliferation could be avoided by simply buying up all known uranium stocks, but within a decade large deposits of it were discovered in many places around the world.
Gray does not, however, give any indication of what available evidence these theories were at odds with, and his appeal to "crucial support" illustrates the very inductivist approach to science that Popper sought to show was logically illegitimate.
Popper held that it is the least likely, or most easily falsifiable, or simplest theory (attributes which he identified as all the same thing) that explains known facts that one should rationally prefer.
However, he knew that the riot instigators were swayed by the Marxist doctrine that class struggle would produce vastly more dead men than the inevitable revolution brought about as quickly as possible, and so had no scruples to put the life of the rioters at risk to achieve their selfish goal of becoming the future leaders of the working class.
After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.
This property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium carbide, nitride, and halide compounds.
There is usually one or more sound holes in the soundboard, either round, oval, or shaped like a calligraphic F (f-hole).
It is a silvery-white metal in the actinide series of the periodic table.
By the 14th century, lutes had disseminated throughout Italy and, probably because of the cultural influence of the Hohenstaufen kings and emperor, based in Palermo, the lute had also made significant inroads into the German-speaking lands.
His son Antonio Vinaccia was active c. 1734 to c. 1796.
Its density is about 70% higher than that of lead, but slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten.
Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion.
In 1972, the French physicist Francis Perrin discovered fifteen ancient and no longer active natural nuclear fission reactors in three separate ore deposits at the Oklo mine in Gabon, West Africa, collectively known as the Oklo Fossil Reactors.
" Thousands were taking up the instrument as a pastime, and it became an instrument of society, taken up by young men and women.
The Earth's crust from the surface to 25 km (15 mi) down is calculated to contain 1017 kg (2×1017 lb) of uranium while the oceans may contain 1013 kg (2×1013 lb).
Mandolin orchestras were formed worldwide, incorporating not only the mandolin family of instruments, but also guitars, double basses and zithers.
The mandolin's paired strings facilitate this technique: the plectrum (pick) strikes each of a pair of strings alternately, providing a more full and continuous sound than a single string would.
The Neapolitan style has an almond-shaped body resembling a bowl, constructed from curved strips of wood.
This new style is credited to mandolins designed and built by Orville Gibson, a Kalamazoo, Michigan luthier who founded the "Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Co., Limited" in 1902.
The members of The Beatles were made MBEs in 1965.
Some notable modern American carved mandolin manufacturers include, in addition to Kay, Gibson, Weber, Monteleone and Collings.
The international repertoire of music for mandolin is almost unlimited, and musicians use it to play various types of music.
Travelling mandolin virtuosi like Giuseppe Pettine, Raffaele Calace and Silvio Ranieri contributed to the mandolin becoming a "fad" instrument in the early 20th century.
The Order is limited to 300 Knights and Dames Grand Cross, 845 Knights and Dames Commander, and 8,960 Commanders.
Today only a few groups remain: Royal Estudiantina la Napolitaine (founded in 1904) in Antwerp, Brasschaats mandoline orkest in Brasschaat and an orchestra in Mons (Bergen).
The players, teachers and composers included Giovanni Fouchetti, Eduardo Mezzacapo, Gabriele Leon, and Gervasio.
During the Golden age itself (1880s-1920s), the mandolin had a strong presence in France.
The researchers suspect that other Arctic animals as well may not show circadian rhythms in the constant light of summer and the constant dark of winter.
When CCA1 and LHY are overexpressed (under constant light or dark conditions), plants become arrhythmic, and mRNA signals reduce, contributing to a negative feedback loop.
This finding and further computational modeling of TOC1 gene functions and interactions suggest a reframing of the plant circadian clock as a triple negative-component repressilator model rather than the positive/negative-element feedback loop characterizing the clock in mammals.
Many more genetic components of the biological clock are now known.
Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is C-G-C-G, which corresponds to Sa-Pa-Sa-Pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style.
This tuning corresponds to the way violins are tuned for carnatic classical music.
The earliest recorded account of a circadian process dates from the 4th century B.C.E., when Androsthenes, a ship captain serving under Alexander the Great, described diurnal leaf movements of the tamarind tree.
Though almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for Irish traditional music, virtually all Irish players prefer flat-backed instruments with oval sound holes to the Italian-style bowl-back mandolins or the carved-top mandolins with f-holes favoured by bluegrass mandolinists.
Greatly preferred for formal performance and recording are flat-topped "Irish-style" mandolins (reminiscent of the WWI-era Martin Army-Navy mandolin) and carved (arch) top mandolins with oval soundholes, such as the Gibson A-style of the 1920s.
However, newer research indicates that the melatonin offset may be the more reliable marker.
found that, in young adults, the daily body temperature minimum occurred at about 04:00 (4 a.m.) for morning types but at about 06:00 (6 a.m.) for evening types.
Mike Post Theme, along with many other tracks on Endless Wire.
Thus, the information of the time of the day as relayed by the eyes travels to the clock in the brain, and, through that, clocks in the rest of the body may be synchronised.
Red and blue light are absorbed through several phytochromes and cryptochromes.
Instruments were marketed by teacher-dealers, much as the title character in the popular musical The Music Man.
By the 1930s, single mandolins were becoming more commonly used in southern string band music, most notably by brother duets such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys (Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick) and the more hard-driving Monroe Brothers (Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe).
After the Monroe Brothers broke up in 1939, Bill Monroe formed his own group, after a brief time called the Blue Grass Boys, and completed the transition of mandolin styles from a "parlor" sound typical of brother duets to the modern "bluegrass" style.
Early research into circadian rhythms suggested that most people preferred a day closer to 25 hours when isolated from external stimuli like daylight and timekeeping.
More-or-less independent circadian rhythms are found in many organs and cells in the body outside the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the "master clock".
She has also reigned through various wars and conflicts involving many of her realms.
Some well-known players include Marty Stuart, Vince Gill, and Ricky Skaggs.
Styx released the song Boat on the River in 1980, which featured Tommy Shaw on vocals and mandolin.
One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys.
In 1965, the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for electing a leader, thus relieving her of involvement.

She inherited an estimated £70 million estate from her mother in 2002.
Elizabeth has occasionally faced republican sentiments and severe press criticism of the royal family, but support for the monarchy and her personal popularity remain high.
Two years later, solely in her capacity as Queen of Canada, she revisited the United States and toured Canada.
In 1961, she toured Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Iran.
Harold Macmillan wrote, "The Queen has been absolutely determined all through ...

In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary Royal Family and by televising Prince Charles's investiture as Prince of Wales.
The word "insect" comes from the Latin word insectum, meaning "with a notched or divided body", or literally "cut into", from the neuter singular perfect passive participle of insectare, "to cut into, to cut up", from in- "into" and secare "to cut"; because insects appear "cut into" three sections.
Pliny the Elder introduced the Latin designation as a loan-translation of the Greek word ἔντομος (éntomos) or "insect" (as in entomology), which was Aristotle's term for this class of life, also in reference to their "notched" bodies. "
Many of the early groups became extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event, the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth, around 252 million years ago.

The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings.
Elizabeth was born in London to the Duke and Duchess of York, later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and was the elder of their two daughters.
Later that year Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis.
Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.
Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true.
The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation.
The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects (e.g., caterpillars), especially during their larval stages.
A personal note about her faith often features in her annual Christmas message broadcast to the Commonwealth.

Tony Benn said that the Queen found Trudeau "rather disappointing".
Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart.
Some other species, such as those in the genus of cockroaches known as Diploptera, are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born
Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show polyembryony, where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos.:136–137 Insects may be univoltine, bivoltine or multivoltine, i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year.
Elizabeth has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, is Sovereign of many orders in her own countries, and has received honours and awards from around the world.
They favor biologically-based theories, which point to genetic factors, the early uterine environment, both, or the inclusion of genetic and social factors.
Research over several decades has demonstrated that sexual orientation ranges along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the opposite sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex.
In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form.
This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like).
Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended.
Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers.
A third concern with the Kinsey scale is that it inappropriately measures heterosexuality and homosexuality on the same scale, making one a tradeoff of the other.
These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions.
There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa.
There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound, while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it.
Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2 kHz.
Knowing how much of the population is made up of homosexual individuals influences how this population may be seen or treated by the public and government bodies.
A few insects, such as members of the families Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent.
Voeller generalized this finding and used it as part of the modern gay rights movement to convince politicians and the public that "we [gays and lesbians] are everywhere".
Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes.
Other words may pick up new layers or meaning.
Some moths produce ultrasonic clicks that were once thought to have a role in jamming bat echolocation.
The ultrasonic clicks were subsequently found to be produced mostly by unpalatable moths to warn bats, just as warning colorations are used against predators that hunt by sight.
Most insects are also able to sense vibrations transmitted through surfaces.
[the] measure [of 'the complex components of sexual orientation as differentiated from other aspects of sexual identity at one point in time'] will predict future behavior or orientation.
Some studies report that "[a number of] lesbian women, and some heterosexual women as well, perceive choice as an important element in their sexual orientations."
Pheromones, a type of semiochemical, are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex, for aggregating conspecific individuals of both sexes, for deterring other individuals from approaching, to mark a trail, and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals.
The classification scheme works such that individuals in the same category show the same balance between the heterosexual and homosexual elements in their histories.
Savin Williams (2006) discusses this issue and notes that by basing findings regarding sexual orientation on a single component, researchers may not actually capture the intended population.
Scientific and professional understanding is that "the core attractions that form the basis for adult sexual orientation typically emerge between middle childhood and early adolescence".
In the Carboniferous age, some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm (20 in) wide wingspan.
Nevertheless, Paul Gebhard, subsequent director of the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research, reexamined the data in the Kinsey Reports and concluded that removing the prison inmates and prostitutes barely affected the results.
A few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders.
Psychiatrist Anil Aggrawal explains that androphilia, along with gynephilia, "is needed to overcome immense difficulties in characterizing the sexual orientation of trans men and trans women.
These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.:3, 218–228
Despite seven categories being able to provide a more accurate description of sexual orientation than a dichotomous scale it is still difficult to determine which category individuals should be assigned to.
Six of these questions assess sexual attraction, four assess sexual behavior, and two assess sexual orientation identity.
For each question on the scale that measures homosexuality there is a corresponding question that measures heterosexuality giving six matching pairs of questions.
Taken all together, the six pairs of questions and responses provide a profile of an individual's sexual orientation.
However, results can be further simplified into four summaries that look specifically at responses that correspond to either homosexuality, heterosexuality, bisexuality or asexuality.
It was once thought that homosexuality was the result of faulty psychological development, resulting from childhood experiences and troubled relationships, including childhood sexual abuse.
It has been found that this was based on prejudice and misinformation.
A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well.
Furthermore, reports of same sex behavior usually exceed those of gay, lesbian, or bisexual identification.
The definitions of each category of Ulrichs' classification scheme are as follows:
but I'm one of those people who, if the right circumstance came along, would change my viewpoint".
Therefore, individuals classified as homosexual in one study might not be identified the same way in another depending on which components are assessed and when the assessment is made making it difficult to pin point who is homosexual and who is not and what the overall prevalence within a population may be.
The genome of D. melanogaster was sequenced in 2000, reflecting the organism's important role in biological research.
Nonetheless, some scholars argue that racial categories obviously correlate with biological traits (e.g. phenotype) to some degree, and that certain genetic markers have varying frequencies among human populations, some of which correspond more or less to traditional racial groupings.
Some other cultures do not recognize a homosexual/heterosexual/bisexual distinction.
While men who consistently occupied the passive role were recognized as a distinct group by locals, men who have sex with only women, and men who have sex with women and men, were not differentiated.
Racial discrimination often coincides with racist mindsets, whereby the individuals and ideologies of one group come to perceive the members of an outgroup as both racially defined and morally inferior.
Though researchers generally believe that sexual orientation is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, with biological factors involving a complex interplay of genetic factors and the early uterine environment, they favor biological models for the cause.
As Europeans encountered people from different parts of the world, they speculated about the physical, social, and cultural differences among various human groups.
Subsequent influential classifications by Georges Buffon, Petrus Camper and Christoph Meiners all classified "Negros" as inferior to Europeans.
In the United States the racial theories of Thomas Jefferson were influential.
He saw Africans as inferior to Whites especially in regards to their intellect, and imbued with unnatural sexual appetites, but described Native Americans as equals to whites.
Some historians and researchers argue that the emotional and affectionate activities associated with sexual-orientation terms such as "gay" and "heterosexual" change significantly over time and across cultural boundaries.
This effectively means that populations of organisms must have reached a certain measurable level of difference to be recognised as subspecies.
Dell is currently the #1 shipper of PC monitors in the world.
Whereas Carl Linnaeus established a taxonomy of living organisms based on anatomical similarities and differences, cladistics seeks to establish a taxonomy—
Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed when the company’s Internet site took off in 1996 and 1997.
While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell.
Rachel Caspari (2003) have argued that clades are by definition monophyletic groups (a taxon that includes all descendants of a given ancestor) and since no groups currently regarded as races are monophyletic, none of those groups can be clades.
They suggest that the authors of these studies find support for racial distinctions only because they began by assuming the validity of race. "
By the late 2000s, Dell's "configure to order" approach of manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications from its US facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as PCs became powerful low-cost commodities.
He further observed that even when there is clinal variation, "Race differences are objectively ascertainable biological phenomena…
In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with discount electrical retailer, The Good Guys, known for "Slashing Prices".
It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer AMD.
Leonard Lieberman and Rodney Kirk have pointed out that "the paramount weakness of this statement is that if one gene can distinguish races then the number of races is as numerous as the number of human couples reproducing."
Moreover, the anthropologist Stephen Molnar has suggested that the discordance of clines inevitably results in a multiplication of races that renders the concept itself useless.
The population geneticist Sewall Wright developed one way of measuring genetic differences between populations known as the Fixation index, which is often abbreviated to FST.
The Miami, Florida, facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation, while Dell continues to produce its servers (its most profitable products) in Austin, Texas.
Once the acquisition closes Dell will again publish quarterly financial results, having ceased these on going private in 2013.
However, Risch denied such limitations render the analysis useless: "Perhaps just using someone's actual birth year is not a very good way of measuring age.
Any category you come up with is going to be imperfect, but that doesn't preclude you from using it or the fact that it has utility."
On February 6, 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its "Recycling Works" award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.
The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled.
Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices, instead of being an innovator.
Upon examining the data from the genome mapping, Venter realized that although the genetic variation within the human species is on the order of 1–3% (instead of the previously assumed 1%), the types of variations do not support notion of genetically defined races.
Michael Dell announced a number of initiatives and plans (part of the "Dell 2.0" initiative) to improve the company's financial performance.

The release of Apple's iPad tablet computer had a negative impact on Dell and other major PC vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop PCs.
The one-drop rule or hypodescent rule refers to the convention of defining a person as racially black if he or she has any known African ancestry.
Dell's reputation for poor customer service, since 2002, which was exacerbated as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure, came under increasing scrutiny on the Web.
The study showed that the race concept was widely used among Chinese anthropologists.
By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve on this, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly.
Other private equity firms such as KKR & Co. and TPG Capital declined to submit alternative bids for Dell, citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures, so the "wide-open bidding war" never materialized.
Many others still use the term race, but use it to mean a population, clade, or haplogroup.
This is not surprising since the selective forces of climate are probably the primary forces of nature that have shaped human races with regard not only to skin color and hair form but also the underlying bony structures of the nose, cheekbones, etc.
100 senior executives were scheduled to work in the building by the end of 2000.
Physical anthropology texts argued that biological races exist until the 1970s, when they began to argue that races do not exist.
In addition, the company provides protection services, advisory services, multivendor hardware support, "how-to" support for software applications, collaborative support with many third-party vendors, and online parts and labor dispatching for customers who diagnose and troubleshoot their hardware.
Many consider de facto racial profiling an example of institutional racism in law enforcement.
She defines it further as "a system that locks people not only behind actual bars in actual prisons, but also behind virtual bars and virtual walls", illustrating the second-class citizenship that is imposed on a disproportionate number of people of color, specifically African-Americans.
Dell has launched its first products completely free of PVC and BFRs with the G-Series monitors (G2210 and G2410) in 2009.
Later in the year, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150 million.

It is more probable that this art was introduced later from Anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to Delphi and dormant in several areas of Greece.
The name of Apollo's mother Leto has Lydian origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of Asia Minor.
In a Hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a Babylonian priestess for a certain "purification".
However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon, all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (sibutu) indicates a Babylonian origin.
Scientific progress during the Enlightenment included the discovery of carbon dioxide (fixed air) by the chemist Joseph Black, the argument for deep time by the geologist James Hutton, and the invention of the steam engine by James Watt.
Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society.
The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve the esthetic perfection.
In his 1767 An Essay on the History of Civil Society, Ferguson uses the four stages of progress, a theory that was very popular in Scotland at the time, to explain how humans advance from a hunting and gathering society to a commercial and civil society without "signing" a social contract.
This probably influenced the theory of numbers of Pythagoras, who believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics.
The national Enlightenment differed from its Western European counterpart in that it promoted further modernization of all aspects of Russian life and was concerned with attacking the institution of serfdom in Russia.
Bertrand Russell saw the Enlightenment as a phase in a progressive development, which began in antiquity, and that reason and challenges to the established order were constant ideals throughout that time.
Apollo refused to forgive Clytia for betraying his beloved, and a grieving Clytia wilted and slowly died.
Once inside, spectators were able to participate in a largely egalitarian form of sociability that helped spread Enlightenment ideas.
While the public sphere is generally an integral component of the social study of the Enlightenment, other historians have questioned whether the public sphere had these characteristics.
One of the primary elements of the culture of the Enlightenment was the rise of the public sphere, a "realm of communication marked by new arenas of debate, more open and accessible forms of urban public space and sociability, and an explosion of print culture," in the late 17th century and 18th century.
Elements of the public sphere included: it was egalitarian, it discussed the domain of "common concern," and argument was founded on reason.
Habermas uses the term "common concern" to describe those areas of political/social knowledge and discussion that were previously the exclusive territory of the state and religious authorities, now open to critical examination by the public sphere.
The values of this bourgeois public sphere included holding reason to be supreme, considering everything to be open to criticism (the public sphere is critical), and the opposition of secrecy of all sorts.
But many works were sold without running into any legal trouble at all.
However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction:
The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives Apollonian and Dionysian.
The evolution of the Greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal Kouros type in early archaic period, to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in late archaic period.
The forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas.
The Greek words oida (οἶδα, "(I) know") and eidos (εἶδος, "species") have the same root as the word idea (ἰδέα), indicating how the Greek mind moved from the gift of the senses, to the principles beyond the senses.
The Greek sculptors considered the senses more important, and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual.
The quarto and octavo editions were much less expensive than previous editions, making the Encyclopédie more accessible to the non-elite.
The sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is, and embodied the archaic smile of good manners, the firm and springy step, the balance of the body, dignity, and youthful happiness.
Many of the Masons values seemed to greatly appeal to Enlightenment values and thinkers.
It seems that he was influenced by the theories of Pythagoras.
Spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form.
Katsuyah Nakawaka attached a Game & Watch D-pad to the Famicom prototype and found that it was easy to use and had no discomfort.

During August and September 2004, there was an intense focus on events that occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
A variety of games for the FDS were released by Nintendo (including some like Super Mario Bros. which had already been released on cartridge) and third party companies such as Konami and Taito.
Many FDS disks have no dust covers (except in some unlicensed and bootleg variants) and are easily prone to getting dirt on the media.
After only two years, the FDS was discontinued, although vending booths remained in place until 1993 and Nintendo continued to service drives, and to rewrite and offer replacement disks until 2003.

At that time the Liberals' coalition partner, the Country Party, the older of the two in the coalition (now known as the "National Party"), had considerable influence over the government's economic policies.
It was not until the late 1970s and through their period out of power federally in the 1980s that the party came to be influenced by what was known as the "New Right" – a conservative liberal group who advocated market deregulation, privatisation of public utilities, reductions in the size of government programs and tax cuts.
The Liberals' immediate predecessor was the United Australia Party (UAP).
In December 1993, the Famicom received a similar redesign.
It took the name "Liberal" in honour of the old Commonwealth Liberal Party.
The system has an available color palette of 48 colors and 6 grays.
A conservative youth group Menzies had set up, the Young Nationalists, was also merged into the new party.
It became the nucleus of the Liberal Party's youth division, the Young Liberals.
The standard display resolution of the NES is 256 horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels.
Encouraged by these successes, Nintendo soon turned its attention to the North American market.
Nintendo entered into negotiations with Atari to release the Famicom under Atari’s name as the name Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System.
After an initial loss to Labor at the 1946 election, Menzies led the Liberals to victory at the 1949 election, and the party stayed in office for a record 23 years—still the longest unbroken run in government at the federal level.
External Affairs Minister Percy Spender had put forward the proposal to work along similar lines to the NATO Alliance.
This text was later changed to "Official Nintendo Seal of Quality".
In the early 1950s, external affairs minister Percy Spender helped to establish the Colombo Plan for providing economic aid to underdeveloped nations in Australia's region.
The earliest produced Famicom units initially had square A and B buttons.
Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the risk.
Bonner was chosen by the Liberal Party to fill a Senate vacancy in 1971 and celebrated his maiden parliamentary speech with a boomerang throwing display on the lawns of Parliament.
Fraser won in a landslide at the resulting 1975 election.
Liberal minister, Don Chipp split off from the party to form a new social liberal party, the Australian Democrats in 1977.
Howard differed from his Labor predecessor Paul Keating in that he supported traditional Australian institutions like the Monarchy in Australia, the commemoration of ANZAC Day and the design of the Australian flag, but like Keating he pursued privatisation of public utilities and the introduction of a broad based consumption tax (although Keating had dropped support for a GST by the time of his 1993 election victory).
In March 2011, the New South Wales Liberal-National Coalition led by Barry O'Farrell won government with the largest election victory in post-war Australian history at the State Election.

T. Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol.
He was most unwilling to accept the dignity, for he clearly foresaw the difficulties in which it would involve him.
John McEwen replaced Arthur Fadden as leader of the Country Party in March 1958 and the Menzies-McEwen Coalition was returned again at elections in November 1958 – their third victory against Labor's H. V. Evatt.
Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign.
Translated into several languages, it played an important role in the spreading of the ascetic ideal in Eastern and Western Christianity.
The LCL's Steele Hall governed for one term from the 1968 election to the 1970 election and during this time began the process of dismantling the Playmander.
They have since remained in opposition under a record five Opposition Leaders.
In Japanese, they are usually referred to as bushi (武士?, [bu.ɕi]) or buke (武家?).
According to translator William Scott Wilson: "In Chinese, the character 侍 was originally a verb meaning "to wait upon" or "accompany persons" in the upper ranks of society, and this is also true of the original term in Japanese, saburau.
These soldiers were required to supply their own weapons, and in return were exempted from duties and taxes.
It was called "Gundan-Sei" (軍団制) by later historians and is believed to have been short-lived.[citation needed]
He embraced a subordinationist Christology which taught that Christ was the divine Son (Logos) of God, made, not begotten, heavily influenced by Alexandrian thinkers like Origen, and which was a common Christological view in Alexandria at the time.
Originally the Emperor and non-warrior nobility employed these warrior nobles.
He established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert, including Pachomius, which proved very valuable to him over the years.
Shortly thereafter, Athanasius became occupied with the theological disputes against Arians within the Byzantine Empire that would occupy much of his life.
A full Council of the Church was convened / summoned there in deference to the Roman pontiff's wishes.
Two conciliar letters were prepared, one to the clergy and faithful of Alexandria, the other to the bishops of Egypt and Libya, in which the will of the Council was made known.

A preliminary conference was held by the Arians at Sirmium, to agree a formula of faith.
In the first part, Athanasius attacks several pagan practices and beliefs.
Throughout most of his career, Athanasius had many detractors.
In defining how a modern Japan should be, members of the Meiji government decided to follow the footsteps of the United Kingdom and Germany, basing the country on the concept of noblesse oblige.
Samurai were not a political force under the new order.
Athanasius is counted as one of the four great Eastern Doctors of the Church in the Roman Catholic Church.
For example, Iwasaki Yatarō, who was the great-grandson of a samurai, established Mitsubishi.
Its famous catechetical school, while sacrificing none of its famous passion for orthodoxy since the days of Pantaenus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen of Alexandria, Dionysius and Theognostus, had begun to take on an almost secular character in the comprehensiveness of its interests, and had counted influential pagans among its serious auditors.
He also ordered his followers to put forth great effort in studying the military classics, especially those related to loyalty and filial piety.
On the eve of the battle of Sekigahara, he volunteered to remain behind in the doomed Fushimi Castle while his lord advanced to the east.
He was ordered into banishment to Beroea, in Thrace; Beroea (Thrace).
You may not be in the wrong to think that the world is always subject to change, but the warrior must not entertain this way of thinking, for his fate is always determined."
Xavier further describes the honour and manners of the people:
In December 1547, Francis was in Malacca (Malaysia) waiting to return to Goa (India) when he met a low-ranked samurai named Anjiro (possibly spelled "Yajiro").
Shortly thereafter, however, Constantine's son, the new Roman Emperor Constantius II, renewed the order for Athanasius's banishment in 338.
In many cases, taking a concubine was akin to a marriage.
They are, it is true, in the places, but outside of the true Faith; while you are outside the places indeed, but the Faith, within you.

So the Missals showed different last Gospel for certain Feast days.
Various other components of armor protected the samurai's body.
This violence originated with unemployed whites who were determined to drive the Chinese from Seattle (anti-Chinese riots also occurred in Tacoma).
In Japanese literature, there is an early reference to samurai in the Kokinshū (古今集, early 10th century):
Bushi was the name given to the ancient Japanese soldiers from traditional warrior families.
The term Bushidō, the "way of the warrior", is derived from this term and the mansion of a warrior was called bukeyashiki.
in 1905, studies of Kobudo and traditional Budō indicate that the samurai were as practical on the battlefield as were any other warrior.
Despite the rampant romanticism of the 20th century, samurai could be disloyal and treacherous (e.g., Akechi Mitsuhide), cowardly, brave, or overly loyal (e.g., Kusunoki Masashige).
There were, however, also notable instances where samurai would be disloyal to their lord or daimyo, when loyalty to the Emperor was seen to have supremacy.
Lake Washington's waters flow to Puget Sound through the Lake Washington Ship Canal (consisting of two man-made canals, Lake Union, and the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks at Salmon Bay, ending in Shilshole Bay on Puget Sound).

Becoming a product of his environment, Algren joins the samurai clan in an attempt to rescue a captured samurai leader.
Instead, it furnishes a criticism or comparison that compares the state and behavior of the product against oracles—principles or mechanisms by which someone might recognize a problem.
Due to local variations in microclimate, Seattle also receives significantly lower precipitation than some other locations west of the Cascades.
In November, Seattle averages more rainfall than any other U.S. city of more than 250,000 people; it also ranks highly in winter precipitation.
Seattle is one of the five rainiest major U.S. cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation, and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the lower 48 states, along with some cities in the Northeast, Ohio and Michigan.
When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection.
Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur north and south of town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers.
Seasonal snowfall has ranged from zero in 1991–92 to 67.5 in (171 cm) in 1968–69, with trace amounts having occurred as recently as 2009–10.
On occasion, Seattle experiences somewhat more significant weather events.
Lack of adaptation to the heavy rain contributed to five deaths and widespread flooding and damage.
In 2006, after growing by 4,000 citizens per year for the previous 16 years, regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow by 200,000 people by 2040.
There are generally four recognized levels of tests: unit testing, integration testing, component interface testing, and system testing.
The earliest Chinese-Americans that came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were almost entirely from Guangdong province.
According to a 2012 HistoryLink study, Seattle's 98118 ZIP code (in the Columbia City neighborhood) was one of the most diverse ZIP Code Tabulation Areas in the United States.
The practice of component interface testing can be used to check the handling of data passed between various units, or subsystem components, beyond full integration testing between those units.
OAT is a common type of non-functional software testing, used mainly in software development and software maintenance projects.
This results in the unintended consequence that the latest work may not function on earlier versions of the target environment, or on older hardware that earlier versions of the target environment was capable of using.
Prior to moving its headquarters to Chicago, aerospace manufacturer Boeing (#30) was the largest company based in Seattle.
Development Testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is promoted to QA; this strategy is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software as well as the efficiency of the overall development and QA process.
All are typically attended by 100,000 people annually, as are the Seattle Hempfest and two separate Independence Day celebrations.
After the integration testing of lower level integrated modules, the next level of modules will be formed and can be used for integration testing.
Regional history collections are at the Loghouse Museum in Alki, Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park, the Museum of History and Industry and the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture.
Software testing is a part of the software quality assurance (SQA) process.:347 In SQA, software process specialists and auditors are concerned for the software development process rather than just the artifacts such as documentation, code and systems.
Seattle's professional sports history began at the start of the 20th century with the PCHA's Seattle Metropolitans, which in 1917 became the first American hockey team to win the Stanley Cup.
The Seahawks have advanced to the Super Bowl three times: 2005, 2013 and 2014.
Though international relations including international treaties are primarily the responsibility of the federal level, the constituent states have certain limited powers in this area: in matters that affect them directly, the states defend their interests at the federal level through the Bundesrat (literally Federal Council, the upper house of the German Federal Parliament) and in areas where they have legislative authority they have limited powers to conclude international treaties "with the consent of the federal government".
A 2008 United States Census Bureau survey showed that Seattle had the highest percentage of college and university graduates of any major U.S. city.
The weekly LGBT newspaper is the Seattle Gay News.
There are also several ethnic newspapers, including the The Facts, Northwest Asian Weekly and the International Examiner, and numerous neighborhood newspapers.
Washington State Ferries, which manages the largest network of ferries in the United States and third largest in the world, connects Seattle to Bainbridge and Vashon Islands in Puget Sound and to Bremerton and Southworth on the Kitsap Peninsula.
However, it was in many ways de facto integrated with West Germany under a special status.
Only two roads, Interstate 5 and State Route 99 (both limited-access highways), run uninterrupted through the city from north to south.
Seattle has the 8th worst traffic congestion of all American cities, and is 10th among all North American cities.
In 2001, Time magazine selected Seattle Central Community College as community college of the year, stating the school "pushes diverse students to work together in small teams".
Three changes are of particular note: on January 1, 1934, Mecklenburg-Schwerin was united with the neighbouring Mecklenburg-Strelitz; and, by the Greater Hamburg Act (Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz), from April 1, 1937, the area of the city-state was extended, while Lübeck lost its independence and became part of the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein.
In this case, the bill had to be introduced again and after passing had to be confirmed by referendum in the Federal Republic as a whole (paragraph 4).
Since the deadline passed on 5 May 1958 without anything happening the Hesse state government filed a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court in October 1958.
An expert commission was established, named after its chairman, the former Secretary of State Professor Werner Ernst.
It provided an alternative proposal for both northern Germany and central and southwestern Germany.
The states are parliamentary republics and the relationship between their legislative and executive branches mirrors that of the federal system: the legislatures are popularly elected for four or five years (depending on the state), and the Minister-President is then chosen by a majority vote among the Landtag's members.
The storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration, which means that information is not retained indefinitely.
The parliament for Berlin is called the Abgeordnetenhaus (House of Representatives), while Bremen and Hamburg both have a Bürgerschaft.
With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to "see" more than they can actually report.
Such programs typically relate to youth, schools, public health, and social assistance.
In southwestern Germany, territorial revision seemed to be a top priority since the border between the French and American occupation zones was set along the Autobahn Karlsruhe-Stuttgart-Ulm (today the A8).
Most common glass contains other ingredients to change its properties.
The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already.
Hippocampal damage may also cause memory loss and problems with memory storage.
Flat glass for windows and similar applications is formed by the float glass process, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity.
In contrast, procedural memory (or implicit memory) is not based on the conscious recall of information, but on implicit learning.
In other words, when asked to imitate a two-step action sequence (such as putting a toy car in the base and pushing in the plunger to make the toy roll to the other end), 9-month-olds tend to imitate the actions of the sequence in the correct order (step 1 and then step 2).
The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection.
The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface.
Declarative memory can be further sub-divided into semantic memory, concerning principles and facts taken independent of context; and episodic memory, concerning information specific to a particular context, such as a time and place.
These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored.
These are key events in one's life that can be remembered clearly.
Visual memory is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience.
Visual memory can result in priming and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon.[citation needed]
Indigenous development of glass technology in South Asia may have begun in 1730 BCE.
There is retroactive interference, when learning new information makes it harder to recall old information and proactive interference, where prior learning disrupts recall of new information.
Although interference can lead to forgetting, it is important to keep in mind that there are situations when old information can facilitate learning of new information.
Brain areas involved in the neuroanatomy of memory such as the hippocampus, the amygdala, the striatum, or the mammillary bodies are thought to be involved in specific types of memory.
Glucocorticoids that are released during stress damage neurons that are located in the hippocampal region of the brain.
Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation.
Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion.
Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis.
System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS).
The most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance.
Therefore, it is important to get the proper amount of sleep so that memory can function at the highest level.
A UCLA research study published in the June 2006 issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that people can improve cognitive function and brain efficiency through simple lifestyle changes such as incorporating memory exercises, healthy eating, physical fitness and stress reduction into their daily lives.
No long term follow up was conducted, it is therefore unclear if this intervention has lasting effects on memory.
This phase is the first phase, or "primary phase," to form in the Al-Fe-Si system during rapid cooling.
Interestingly, experimental evidence indicates that this phase forms by a first-order transition.
Korsakoff's syndrome, also known as Korsakoff's psychosis, amnesic-confabulatory syndrome, is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex.
Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with hit.
Although the atomic structure of glass shares characteristics of the structure in a supercooled liquid, glass tends to behave as a solid below its glass transition temperature.
This helps to explain why both crystalline and non-crystalline solids exhibit rigidity on most experimental time scales.
In 1905 the value E, the minimal energy increment of a hypothetical oscillator, was theoretically associated by Einstein with a "quantum" or minimal element of the energy of the electromagnetic wave itself.
Classical statistical mechanics requires the existence of h (but does not define its value).
Equivalently, the smallness of the Planck constant reflects the fact that everyday objects and systems are made of a large number of particles.
Each photon has an energy E = hf = 6981358000000000000♠
In 2008 Barack Obama was elected as the first multiracial President of the United States; he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as African American.
The black-body problem was revisited in 1905, when Rayleigh and Jeans (on the one hand) and Einstein (on the other hand) independently proved that classical electromagnetism could never account for the observed spectrum.
The very first Solvay Conference in 1911 was devoted to "the theory of radiation and quanta".
Max Planck received the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics "in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta".
Creolization, assimilation and integration have been continuing processes.
There are a number of other such pairs of physically measurable values which obey a similar rule.
The either-or nature of uncertainty forces measurement attempts to choose between trade offs, and given that they are quanta, the trade offs often take the form of either-or (as in Fourier analysis), rather than the compromises and gray areas of time series analysis.
It is defined in terms of the reduced Planck constant, the elementary charge and the electron mass, all of which depend on the Planck constant: the final dependence on h1/2 (r2 > 0.995) can be found by expanding the variables.
The CODATA value quoted here is based on three watt-balance measurements of KJ2RK and one inter-laboratory determination of the molar volume of silicon, but is mostly determined by a 2007 watt-balance measurement made at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
More importantly, the values of the Planck constant obtained in this way cannot be used as tests of the theories without falling into a circular argument.
From the definition of the conventional watt W90, this gives a measure of the product KJ2RK in SI units, where RK is the von Klitzing constant which appears in the quantum Hall effect.
Together with publicity about the ancestry of President Barack Obama, whose father was from Kenya, some black writers have argued that new terms are needed for recent immigrants.
The X-ray crystal density method is primarily a method for determining the Avogadro constant NA but as the Avogadro constant is related to the Planck constant it also determines a value for h.
After European settlement increased, traders and fur trappers often married or had unions with women of native tribes.
The Planck constant is a leading contender to form the basis of the new definition, although not the only one.
Possible new definitions include "the mass of a body at rest whose equivalent energy equals the energy of photons whose frequencies sum to 7050135639273999999♠135639274×1042 Hz", or simply "the kilogram is defined so that the Planck constant equals 6966662606895999999♠6.62606896×10−34 J⋅s".
Public policy and political leadership helps to "level the playing field" and drive the wider acceptance of renewable energy technologies.
As of 2014, Germany has a commitment to the "Energiewende" transition to a sustainable energy economy, and Denmark has a commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2050.
In the South, some Chinese married into the black and mulatto communities, as generally discrimination meant they did not take white spouses.
During the five-years from the end of 2004 through 2009, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies.
Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity.
Biomass for heat and power is a fully mature technology which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes.
First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.
Numerous advertisements requested the return of African Americans who had married Indigenous Americans or who spoke an Indigenous American language.
Interracial relationships, common-law marriages, and marriages occurred since the earliest colonial years, especially before slavery hardened as a racial caste associated with people of African descent in the British colonies.
Castro Photovoltaic Power Station (Italy, 84.2 MW), Eggebek Solar Park (Germany 83.6 MW), Senftenberg Solarpark (Germany 82 MW), Finsterwalde Solar Park (Germany, 80.7 MW), Okhotnykovo Solar Park (Russia, 80 MW), Lopburi Solar Farm (Thailand 73.16 MW), Rovigo Photovoltaic Power Plant (Italy, 72 MW), and the Lieberose Photovoltaic Park (Germany, 71.8 MW).
Some of the second-generation renewables, such as wind power, have high potential and have already realised relatively low production costs.
Ehrenstein went on to say "He's there to assuage white 'guilt' they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in American history."
Solar thermal power stations include the 354 megawatt (MW) Solar Energy Generating Systems power plant in the USA, Solnova Solar Power Station (Spain, 150 MW), Andasol solar power station (Spain, 100 MW), Nevada Solar One (USA, 64 MW), PS20 solar power tower (Spain, 20 MW), and the PS10 solar power tower (Spain, 11 MW).

In 2013, however, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis.
The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins.
